If the  first relationship in (3.43) is used to eliminate dg/dt from (3.44), the result is:  XX" s«>  < 345 >  This is readily integrated to give the solution for /<(?) so long as a / b:  /'(')=  7  e'"'S(t')d,'  (3.46)  a — o Jo  Solving the first equation in (3.43) for dh/dt and substituting into (3.44) yields a similar  solution for g(t):  g(<)=j^~  I'e'"' S{t')dt'  (3.47)  b-aJo  Substitution (3.46) and (3.47) into (3.41) produces the solution to (3.39) for any forcing  function S(t). This result may be stated as a theorem:  Theorem 3:  when a ^ b  x(t) = A t  The solution to  is given by:  }-"' +BtTb'  where A and B are arb  d2A  d?2  X- trary  the equation  +<«+*>£  '  / ' e - ( ' - ' '  -a Jo  constants ch  + abx =  S(t')dt  S(t)  1  '  a - osen to satisfy  / '  -Ht- bJo  ']S(t')dt'  the initial conditions.  Thus, we see that Theorem 3 is a straightforward generalization of Theorem 1 to the  case of a second order system. In both cases the forcing function appears in convolution  integrals involving the exponential decay eigenfunctions we found in solving the homo- geneous equation. In the case of critical damping, a = b, so Theorem 3 will not apply.  However, the same approach using variation of parameters can be shown to solve the  problem in that case as well.  You may find the choice of (3.43) as a second equation relating g(t) and /;(?) to be a  somewhat capricious if clever trick. In a sense this is true. However, a second equation  relating g and h is essential if the problem is to be solved. Furthermore, the equation in  Theorem 3 does have a unique solution, as is proved in more extended treatments of  46  Spikes, decisions, and actions  linear differential equations. Therefore, we can be certain that our choice of (3.43) has  allowed us to derive the unique solution to (3.39).  Congratulations! You have now covered those aspects of the theory of first and second  order linear differential equations that are most relevant to contemporary neuroscience.  Although mathematics courses in linear differential equations certainly include more  material, the additional topics are generally of less scientific interest. Furthermore, we will  soon cover some of these topics, such as differential equations with time-varying coef- ficients in the much more general context of nonlinear dynamics, which is where they truly  belong.  3.7  Exercises  1.
