+0.03, so (20, 20) is an unstable saddle point. Thus, trajectories will leave the vicinity of the  saddle point at (20,20) and approach the nearer of the two asymptotically stable nodes. It is  worth noting, however, that this decision network also exhibits hysteresis: once one neuron  has suppressed the other, there must be a large increase in the stimulus to the second neuron  before it can become active. Thus, there is resistance to change in this network once a  decision has been made, which is also a characteristic of much human cognition!  We have now completed an analysis of several systems composed of two interacting  neurons. Such systems can have multiple equilibrium points, which permit them to per- form short-term memory tasks and to make decisions. Although two neuron systems are  far too small to provide plausible explanations for complex mental phenomena, the next  chapter will show that the principles learned above generalize to much larger and more  interesting neural networks.  6.8  Exercises  1. Analyze the following divisive gain control circuit consisting of a bipolar cell B and an  amacrine cell A. Let rA = 20 ms and rB = 50 ms. (a) Obtain the general formula for the  equilibrium point in the first quadrant as a function of the light level L. (b) For L= 100  and for E = 10 000 determine the stability, being sure to indicate the Jacobian. (c) Simulate  these equations for 800 ms using RungeKutta4.m and plot B(t) and Alt) for each of the two  L values above.

The divisive gain control network below is more complex, because A depends on B2.  Analyze this network and its response when L = 10 000, TA = 15 ms and rB = 30ms.  (You will have to use the MatLab roots function to solve for the steady states.) After  analyzing the stability of any physiologically relevant steady states, simulate 500 ms of the  response for .4(0) = 0, B(0) = 0.

Simulate the response of the network for each of the  following initial conditions: (a) E\ = 4, E2 = 7; (b) E\ = 8, F2 = 20.  4. Suppose that the short-term memory network in eqn (6.8) involves excitatory con- nections between two neurons in different brain structures such as the frontal cortex and a  subcortical nucleus. In this case, one would expect some delay in the transmission of  excitation between the neurons. Modify the equations to include delay equations with  time constants 6 in the two excitatory paths using the approach developed in Chapter 4. Is  there a critical delay 6C at which the equilibrium point at (80,80) becomes unstable?  Simulate the system with 6 = 10 ms and plot the time course of the responses. Assume that  the stimulus has intensity 200 and lasts for 250 ms, and run your simulation for a total  of 2000ms. Compare your results with the data in Fig. 6.3.  5.
