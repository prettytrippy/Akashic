Wiltshire  To Fran, whose loving support  and intellectual companionship  made this book possible  Preface  There is one central reason why all neuroscientists and biopsychologists should be conver- sant with nonlinear dynamics. Nonlinear dynamics reveals and elucidates a range of phe- nomena that are simply inconceivable in the more mundane world of linear systems theory.  Memory and forgetting, decision making, motor control, action potentials, and perhaps even  free will and determinism can no longer be intelligently conceptualized without a basic  understanding of nonlinear systems. At the deepest level, therefore, my decision to write this  book was predicated on the belief that an understanding of brain function and behavior must  be grounded in a conceptual framework informed by nonlinear dynamics.  When I received my Ph.D. in theoretical chemistry in 1969 I was not familiar with many  of the nonlinear dynamical phenomena developed in this book, and others such as chaos  were just being discovered and understood by mathematicians. Theoretical chemistry and  physics of the time did deal with nonlinearities, but the general approach was to hope that  they were small and then expand solutions in a Taylor series retaining only the first few  terms. When I was given the opportunity to switch my focus to mathematical biology by  Stuart Rice, my Ph.D. advisor, and Jack Cowan, who offered me a postdoctoral position in  the Department of Theoretical Biology at The University of Chicago, my awareness of non- linear dynamical phenomena began to expand immensely.  As a result of this new exposure to nonlinear dynamics, I began to use these dynamical con- cepts in my own research on the visual system, and I designed a graduate level course in 1973  to teach these concepts to others. For the first few years the course was populated by a combi- nation of theoretical biology, physics, and chemistry students. Then the physics and chemistry  departments began offering this material to their students, so my course was discontinued. It  was due to the recent upsurge of interest in neural modeling, connectionist and otherwise, that  I decided to resurrect the course and restructure it to focus exclusively on neuroscience. Just  as physicists are aided in learning mathematics by using examples such as oscillating springs
