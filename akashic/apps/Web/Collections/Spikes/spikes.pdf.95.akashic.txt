disappears, because the /AHP current is no longer strong enough to hyperpolarize the  neuron to a level below the point where spiking ceases. Thus, a slow hyperpolarizing  current can produce neuronal bursting via a hysteresis loop when it is incorporated into a  Neural adaptation and bursting  161  Class II neuron model exhibiting a hard Hopf bifurcation as the resting state becomes  unstable.  10.3 Calcium currents and parabolic bursting  The previous example of neural bursting is the simplest type to analyze mathematically,  because it involves just one additional current that drives the spike-generating apparatus  through a hysteresis loop. However, most bursting neurons are driven by a more complex  combination of ionic currents. The most important of these are neurons that incorporate  both a transient inward Ca 4 (calcium) current Ij, which depolarizes the neuron, and an  /AHP hyperpolarizing current that is mediated by Ca2+. Several examples of neural  bursting thought to be driven by the combination of Ij and /AHP currents are illustrated in  Fig. 10.4. The model presented here is a modified version of the Plant (1981) model for  bursting in aplysia neurons (Fig. 10.4A) that has been subjected to detailed mathematical  analysis by Rinzel and Lee (1987). Let us adapt eqn (9.10) by adding two additional  currents controlled by the conductance variables Xand C:  ^ = - { 1 7 . 8 1 + 47.58 F + 33.8 V2}(V - 0.48)  -26/v(F + 0.95) - 1.93*0 - 0 . 5 C ) ( F - 1.4) - 3.25C( V+ 0.95)  ^ - = — ( - / \ + 1.29F + 0.79 + 3.3(F + 0.38)2)  (10.3)  d?  5.6 V  /  ^ - = -!-(-A'+7.33(F + 0.86)(F+0.84))  d?  30  The variable X represents the Ca2+ conductance, which is a quadratically accelerating  function of Fat subthreshold levels. Because the equilibrium potential for Ca2+ is about  + 1.4 (i.e. +140 mV), the X variable controls a depolarizing current that affects V through  the term 1.9 3 *(1 -Q.5C)(V-  1.4). The factor (1 - 0.5C) in this expression, which is not  present in the original Plant (1981) model, reflects evidence that /T currents inactivate  (Hille, 1992; Johnston and Wu, 1995). This method of approximating inactivation was  developed by Rinzel (1985) to simplify the Hodgkin-Huxley equations by letting  k = 1 — n and was discussed in deriving (9.3) in the previous chapter. As will be seen, the  current controlled by A'triggers action potential bursts.  The second effect of A'is to increase the concentration of internal Ca2+ represented by  the variable C, by providing the input to the dC/dt equation. C in turn is the very slow  (time constant of 100 ms) Ca2+ -modulated conductance of a separate K+ channel, which  is represented in the Fequation by the term -3.25C( V + 0.95), the equilibrium potential  of K+ being chosen as -0.95 (-95 mV). This is a more accurate description of an /AHP  current that is modulated by Ca2+. The dC/dt equation in (10.3) lacks the Vdependence  of the comparable equation in the Plant (1981) model, because of evidence that most  mammalian /AHP currents are not voltage gated (Johnston and Wu, 1995).  162  Spikes, decisions, and actions  A JLXJil  Aplysia R15  B  TTX  _j40mV  10 s  ,!m^J  40 ms  Fig. 10.4 Examples of bursting neurons.
