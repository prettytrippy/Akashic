H\  and H2 must both be periodic with period 27r for these equations to meaningfully describe  phace coupling. The assumption that the coupling functions depend only on phase dif- ference is an approximation that is exact in the limit of weak coupling (Kopell, 1988;  Ermentrout, 1994). As phase continuously varies during each cycle of the oscillation, it is  only necessary to consider the phase difference between the two oscillators to determine  whether they have a constant phase relationship. Let us define the variable </> = 92 - 9\  and generate a new equation by subtracting the first from the second equation in (12.2).  The result is:  4- = u2-u)i+H2(-(j>)-Hi(<j>)  (12.3)  d?  Even without considering explicit forms for H\ and H2, we can obtain some very general  resultsconcerning the effects of oscillator coupling in (12.3). First, however, two definitions  are necessary. Two oscillators are phase locked when the phase difference between them is  constant and independent of time. (This is 1 : 1 phase locking; 2 : 1,3: 1, etc. phase locking  can also occur as in Fig. 9.12.) Two oscillators are synchronized if they are phase locked at  zero phase difference. Given the definition of phase locking, a solution to (12.3) will be  phase locked if and only if d(f>/dt = 0 is an asymptotically stable steady state. Applying the  usual stability analysis, therefore, phase-locked solutions must obey the equation:  u>2-uJi+H2(-4>)-Hl(4>)=0  (12.4)  Asymptotic stability of the solution is guaranteed if:  A[/Y2(-0)-//,(</>)]< 0  (12.5)  where the derivative is evaluated at the equilibrium value of </>. Equation (12.5) is the one- dimensional special case of a Jacobian.  188  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Let us clarify these generalities by solving (12.4) and (12.5) for a particular choice of the  H function. Cohen et al. (1982) chose the simplest function with period 27r, namely:  H,((p) = a, sm(4> + o)  (12.6)  where the synaptic strength a, can vary for the two directions of coupling. The additional  phase shift o > 0 is assumed to be produced by synaptic or conduction delays in the  coupling (Kopell, 1988; Kopell and Ermentrout, 1988). The special case where a = 0  considered by Cohen el al. (1982) describes coupling via electrical gap junctions between  neurons or extremely rapid short-range coupling that produces a negligible phase shift.  Two justifications may be offered for the choice of eqn (12.6). First, (12.6) is the lowest  order in the Fourier series expansion of any 27r periodic function (Cohen et al., 1982;  Rand et ai, 1988). Second, calculations of the //functions for both the Wilson-Cowan  (1972) oscillator and the Morris-Lecar (1981) equations show that H assumes a form  similar to (12.6) as a first approximation (Ermentrout and Kopell, 1991; Ermentrout,  1994). The actual calculation of H involves averaging the effects of small perturbations  over one cycle of the oscillation as a function of phase and is discussed in detail by  Ermentrout and Kopell (1994).  Substitution of (12.6) into (12.3) gives:  — = UJ2 — uj] - a\ sin(0 + a) — a2 sin(</> — a)  (12 d?  where we have used the identity sin(-.v) = - sin(.v). Equation (12.4) for the phase-locked  states now becomes:  u>2 — u>\ - fl| sin(0 + a) - a2 sm((p — a) = 0  (12
