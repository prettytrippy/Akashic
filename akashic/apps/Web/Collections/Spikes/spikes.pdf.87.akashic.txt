a, where F = —0.75 (-75 mV), is an asymptotically stable node, while b and c are an  unstable saddle point and an unstable spiral point respectively. Threshold is reached for  (9.10) when the stable node (a) and unstable saddle point (b) coalesce and vanish at a  148  Spikes, decisions, and actions  0.8  0.6  U.2  n  /  /  dR/dt = 0 '  N  1  '  a\  X  b  A  dV/dt - 0 1  '  ''  '1  B  i  i  i  i  Limit cycle  sub  \  -0.5  0.5  -0.5  0.5  50  -50  -100  Stable  limit cycle  Unstable spiral  y  B V ^ Saddle  -1.0  1.0  Fig. 9.9  Phase planes for (9.10) for/=0(A) and / = 0.5 (B). In A the isoclines intersect in three steady states:  an asymptotically stable node (a), a saddle point (b), and an unstable spiral point (c). In B the node and  saddle point have vanished at a saddle-node bifurcation, resulting in a limit cycle around spiral point c. C  shows the bifurcation diagram for (9.10) as a function of /.  bifurcation, which is therefore very different from a Hopf bifurcation. This leaves only the  unstable spiral point c, around which a limit cycle emerges. This is evident in the bifur- cation diagram in Fig. 9.9C, where limit cycles surround the single unstable spiral point  for / >A, while three steady states, including the resting state at the stable node, exist  between A and B. Because a saddle point and a node coalesce and vanish at A. this is called  a saddle-node bifurcation, and the limit cycle that emerges in such cases will have a finite  amplitude at its inception. This is very different from a Hopf bifurcation where the limit  cycle must originate with infinitesimal amplitude when a single steady state changes from  stable to unstable. Not all saddle-node bifurcations produce limit cycles, and simulations  are generally required to determine whether or not a limit cycle does occur.  Figure 9.10 illustrates the spike train produced by eqn (9.10) for / = 0.22 nA. Note the  two characteristic changes produced by the simulated /A current: a long latency to the first  spike (about 200 ms), and a much lower firing rate (about 5.0 spikes/s) than that produced  by either (9.3) or (9.7) and shown in Fig. 9.3.

Note long latency and low spike rate compared to Fig. 9.3.  (9.10) produces latencies of more than 1 s and spike rates below 1 spike/s! Both the lower  spike rates and the long latencies result from the fact that the dR/dt = 0 isocline lies very  close to the limit cycle in the subthreshold region marked 'sub' in Fig. 9.9B. This means  that dR/dt will be very small in this subthreshold region, so the interval between spikes is  greatly increased relative to the case where the dR/dt isocline is far away (compare with  Fig. 9.2). The greatly reduced spike rates produced by /A have the functional significance  of extending spike rate coding over a much greater dynamic range (Connor et al., 1977;  Rogawski, 1985).  Neurons that can be stimulated to fire at arbitrarily low frequency due to saddle-node  bifurcations are termed Class I neurons, while those that can only begin firing at a rela- tively high frequency resulting from a subcritical Hopf bifurcation are called Class II
