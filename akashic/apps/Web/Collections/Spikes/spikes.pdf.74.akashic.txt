in A > 2 dimensions that depends on a parameter 8:  dX  d? = F(X,/3)  Let Xo be an isolated equilibrium point of this system. Assume that there is a critical  value 0 = a with the following properties determined from the Jacobian,  A{B) : (1 )A'n is asymptotically stable for some finite range of values 3 <a. (2) When  3 = a the system has one pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues A = ±iwwhileall other  eigenvalues have negative real parts. (3) Xo is unstable for some range of values  3 > a. Then either the system possesses an asymptotically stable limit cycle over a  range 0 > a or else it possesses an unstable limit cycle over some range 3 < a. Near  8 = n the frequency of this oscillation will be approximately w/2tr, and the oscillation  will emerge with infinitesimal amplitude sufficiently close to a.  Nonlinear oscillations  127  The Hopf bifurcation theorem is rather complex, and the proof is even more so.  Qualitatively, however, it is possible to gain a good intuitive grasp of the theorem. As the  theorem applies to N > 2 dimensions, let us consider a classic two-dimensional example:  the van der Pol equation, which provided the first model of heart rhythms. Its normal  form is:  d.v  f = "V  (813)  -±=-Jx  + y((3-x2)  dt  where 0 is the parameter specified in Theorem 11 and to will be shown to be the frequency.  Inspection shows that (0, 0) is the only equilibrium point of this system. At (0, 0) the  Jacobian of the associated linear equations is:  *=(  °,2 I)  (8-14)  -or  so the eigenvalues are:  \ = -(l3±y/p-4<J)  (8.15)  The three requirements on the eigenvalues listed in Theorem 11 are satisfied when (3 = 0,  at which A = ±iu). For 0 < 0 the origin is an asymptotically stable spiral point, and for  /3>0the origin is an unstable spiral. Thus, the Hopf bifurcation theorem indicates that  near the critical value 0 = 0 there will be a limit cycle solution to (8.13) with a frequency  near u>/27r.  The Hopf bifurcation theorem does not tell us whether this is an unstable limit cycle  occurring when 0 < 0 or an asymptotically stable limit cycle for 0 > 0. Furthermore,  Theorem 11 doesnotrevealhowclose/Jmustbetozeroforthelimitcycletoexist. However,  Theorem 11 has done most of our work for us: we know where to look in the parameter space  to find limit cycle behavior. To explore this further, run the simulation VanDerPol.m  with values of 0 near zero and with w = 5, so the predicted limit cycle frequency will be  0.796. Using initial conditions x = 1, y — 0 with 0 = ±0.5, you will readily discover  that an asymptotically stable limit cycle exists for 0 > 0. Furthermore, you will see that  even for 0 = 0.5, which is not all that close to 0 = 0, the frequency is remarkably close  to 0.8.  This example helps to provide an intuitive feel for the Hopf bifurcation theorem. When  0 < 0 in (8.13), the origin is asymptotically stable. When 0 = 0 the linearized system  defined by the Jacobian in (8.14) is stable but not asymptotically stable, and hence line- arization does not reveal whether the origin of (8.13) is asymptotically stable or unstable.  This is the special case not covered by Theorem 8 in which stability is determined entirely  by the nonlinear terms. It is instructive to run VanDerPol.m with 0 = 0 in order to view the  trajectory directions indicated by the arrows in the phase plane.  The effects of the nonlinear terms in (8.13) on stability when 0 = 0 can be determined  through a clever calculation. Multiply the first equation in (8.13) by w2.v and the second  128  Spikes, decisions, and actions  equation by y and add the two to obtain:  d.v  ,  d  u) x — - = u> [ xy,  y — = -ofxy — x y  dt
