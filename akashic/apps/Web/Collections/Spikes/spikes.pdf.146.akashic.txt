the region defined by R{ > 48.5 and R2 > 48.5 we have shown that dU/dt in (14.30) is  negative definite. This region is plotted in gray in Fig. 14.6A. Therefore, U is a Lyapunov  function for the equilibrium point at (80,80). Theorem 13 may now be used to obtain an  estimate of the domain of attraction for this equilibrium. As indicated in Fig. 14.6A, this is  the largest closed contour (7 = a that encloses (80, 80) and falls entirely within the gray  region where dU/dt < 0. All trajectories originating within this droplet-shaped region are  guaranteed to approach (80,80) asymptotically. The same analysis indicates that all  trajectories originating within the indicated region surrounding (0,0) will asymptotically  approach (0,0). Thus, we have obtained finite (rather than infinitesimal as is the case with  linearized analysis) estimates of the domains of attraction of these two equilibria. This  also proves rigorously that this memory system will generalize, because any input pattern  generating an initial condition within the domain of attraction of (80,80) will lead  asymptotically to the same final state, thus recalling the same stored pattern.  Our analysis is not applicable to the third steady state, which is a saddle point at (20,20),  because dU/dt > 0 near this point. The Fyapunov function U is moot regarding the fate  of trajectories originating within any of the white regions of the phase plane in Fig. 14.6A.  This is because contours U = a originating in these regions surround all three steady  states, and thus they encompass zones where d U/dt > 0. The three-dimensional view of U  in Fig. 14.7 suggests that all trajectories will flow down to one of the two asymptotically  stable steady states, but the dividing line between the global domains of attraction of the  two cannot be ascertained given this particular Lyapunov function. Thus, U defined in  yo.3  100  Fig. 14.7 Surface plot of the Lyapunov function (14.29) that was also illustrated in the previous figure. Note  the three minima at the steady states.  244  Spikes, decisions, and actions  (14.29) provides rigorous but conservative (i.e. small subregions) estimates of the  domains of asymptotic stability.  The two-dimensional system in (14.28) is a special case of a more general A-dimen- stonal neural network formulation due to Cohen and Grossberg (1983):  d.v, _  1  d? ~ r,(x,) b,{xi) + YjwijSj(Xj)  /='  14.34)  where i = 1,..., A, and Sj (A,) is a sigmoidal function such as the Naka-Rushton or  logistic function. System (14.28) is a two-dimensional example of (14.34) where T, is a  constant, and b,(x,) = -A,. Equation (14.34) differs somewhat in form from (14.27), as  the summation of synaptic inputs in (14.27) occurs within the argument of the sigmoidal  function, while (14.34) contains summation over sigmoidal functions. However, the two  formulations are very closely related. The Cohen-Grossberg (1983) theorem defines a  Lyapunov function for (14.34) under the following conditions:  Theorem 16 (Cohen-Grossberg):  system (14.34):  (a) irâ€ž = Wji  (b) T,(X,) > 0 for all i; and  (c) dSi(xi)/dx, > 0 for all/.
