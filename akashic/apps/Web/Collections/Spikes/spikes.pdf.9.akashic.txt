~ = Aazc"  y '  dt  Substitution of this into (2.1) leads to the result:  Aaeal =  --ea  T  14  Spikes, decisions, and actions  This equation is easily solved to give a = - l / r , so the solution to (2.1) is just  x = A exp(-?/r). The minus sign on the right side of (2.1) results in a negative value for  the exponent in the solution (r is always positive by convention). As a negative exponent  is generally the most appropriate physiological solution, it has been emphasized,  although the same derivation obviously holds for positive values on the right-hand side.  The constant A may be assigned any value we wish. To determine a unique value of A, we  need to specify an initial condition, namely, a value for .v(?) at ? = 0. Denoting this value  by A0 and substituting into the solution at ? = 0, we see that the solution to (2.1) is:  .v(?)=.v0e-'^  (2.2)  Let us now consider a somewhat more complex equation in which the right-hand side  contains an arbitrary additive function S(t). As we shall see shortly, this may be thought  of as a time-varying stimulus applied to a neuron which responds with spike rate x(t). The  relevant equation is:  ^ = l ( - v + 5(?))  (2-3)  d?  T  Equation (2.1) is referred to as a homogeneous differential equation, because the right side  only contains terms involving the unknown function x. Equation (2.3), on the other hand,  is termed inhomogeneous, because the right-hand side contains an additional term that is  independent of .v. To solve (2.3), let us try to find a solution of the form:  x = Ae~'/T  + H(t)e-'/T  (2.4)  This is just the solution we obtained to (2.1) plus an additional function of time, H(t),  multiplied by the exponential that was obtained from solving (2.1).  Substitution of (2.4) into (2.3) yields:  e_f/T dtf _ 1  e_f/r + He_lf  = 1  _ A g_,/T _ / / e_, / T )  dl  T  T  Cancellation of the second and third terms on both sides gives:  d?  T  This may be solved for //(?) by integration with the result:  / / ( ? ) = - / e''/T5(?')d?'  (2.5)  T Jo  The last step results from isolating dHjdt on the left and then integrating both sides of the  equation. This integration is carried out with respect to the 'dummy variable' ?', which  First order linear systems  15  represents all past times between the start of stimulation at ? = 0 and the present time ?.  Combining (2.2), (2.4), and (2.5), we have proved the theorem:  Theorem 1  is  or  where A is  The solution to the equation:  d.v  1  .v(?) = ^ e - ' / r + - e - ' / T  x(t)=Ae-'/T  + - [ e"  TJo  S(t))  / >  -C-'')/  chosen to satisfy the initial condition.  TS{t  ~S(t  ')d?'  )d?'  To obtain the second form for x(t) in this theorem, the exponential has simply been moved  inside the integral. Many readers will recognize the integral in the solution as a temporal  convolution integral. This convolution adds up effects throughout the past history of  stimulation, S(t'), weighting each past instant ?' by an exponentially decaying function  of the elapsed time between ?' and the present, exp{ —(? - t')/r}. Thus, the influence  of all previous stimulation is summed, but it dies out exponentially as we move further  into the past.  To fix ideas, let us apply Theorem 1 to an example. For time in milliseconds, solve the  equation:  for an initial condition .v(0) = 0. Using Theorem 1 we obtain:  .Y(?)=^e-'/|0 + ^/"e- ('-''»/ , 050d?'  10 7o  The integral is easily evaluated with the result:  1  f
