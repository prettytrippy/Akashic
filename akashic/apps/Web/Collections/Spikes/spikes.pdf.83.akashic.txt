Finally, Fig. 9.2 also shows that the limit  cycles for (9.3) and (9.7) are quite similar in shape when plotted in state space. Fhus, (9.7)  provides a reasonably accurate approximation to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations given  the simplifying assumptions made by Rinzel (1985) to obtain (9.3).  Let us now see how easy the analysis of (9.7) can be. The equilibrium state is given by the  simultaneous solution of (9.5), which becomes, with parameters from (9.7):  -40.7881-'  z3  81.079F2 - 63.302F± 1.25/- 18.553 = 0  (9.8)  142  Spikes, decisions, and actions  This can either be solved for specific values of / using the roots function in MatLab.  For example. / = 0 yields only one real root: V = -0.70, or —70 mV, the same as for the  Hodgkin-Huxley simulations in Fig. 9.3, and R = 0.088 at rest. The Jacobian matrix for  (9.7) is:  -122.36V2 - 118.28 V  0.71053  22.937  -32.5 V - 29.9  -0.52632  (9.9)  where the equilibrium equation for R has been used to eliminate it from the matrix.  Equations (9.8) and (9.9) can now be used to determine the stability of the equilibrium  point for any value of/in the usual way. For example, if/ = 0.25. V = —0.67 from (9.8),  and the eigenvalues of the A matrix are A = 0.53 ± 2.18i, so the steady state is an unstable  spiral point. The Poincare-Bendixon Theorem can now be used to prove the existence of a  limit cycle using a construction similar to that employed for the FitzHugh-Nagumo  equation (see Exercise 1).  9.3 Hysteresis in the squid axon  One of the most striking aspects of dynamical modeling in neuroscience is the fact that  nonlinear equations frequently predict novel phenomena that the creators of the equa- tions had never imagined. As a case in point. Hodgkin and Huxley created their equations  in 1952, yet many years elapsed before it was shown that the equations predicted a novel  hysteresis effect that had never been observed (Cooley et ah, 1965; Rinzel, 1978; Best,  1979). Subsequently, Guttman, Lewis, and Rinzel (1980) tested this prediction and  showed that hysteresis actually occurred in the squid axon. Figure 9.4 shows the results of  their experiment. A squid axon was stimulated with a current / that began at 0 and  <  3.  4  n  100  0  A J  Cur  Ra  • Spi  rent  mp  B  250  Time (ms)  500  Fig. 9.4  Hysteresis in the giant axon of the squid (reproduced with permission.

This triangular variation of / is indicated by the upper trace in Fig. 9.4. The  spikes produced by this stimulation are plotted in the lower trace, where the solid black  area indicates that the spike frequency was too high for the individual spikes to be resolved  on the oscilloscope (time divisions are at 50 ms intervals). The striking observation is that
