sufficient to produce phase locking. Set k = 4 and f = 0.5. Now determine the smallest  value of I2 (to the nearest 0.01) that will produce phase locking and find the frequency.  Compare your results with the predictions of the phase oscillator model in (12.15) and  (12.16).  2. Explore the conditions governing swimming in Clione using the script Clione.m. First  determine the minimum synaptic coupling strength k (to the nearest 0.1) that will produce  ongoing swimming. Next determine the largest time constant rsyn (set at 1.0 ms in the  program) that will still result in swimming. Do this for both the minimum synaptic  coupling strength that you just found and for k = 10 and 20. Finally, determine the spike  frequency for each of these three values of k. Does spike frequency vary significantly as a  function of A:? Suggest a dynamical explanation based on postinhibitory rebound.  3. Consider the following equations for three coupled phase oscillators with identical  frequency inputs:  ~  = UJ +  H](92-9I)  dt  69  —=- = UJ + H2(9]  - 82) + Hi(63 - 82)  dt  d9  -P- = u + H2(62 - 93)  dt  Assume that the coupling functions H have the forms:  H](fj) = a sin(0)  and  H2(<j>) = b sin(0)  First, reduce the system to two equations in the phase differences 0i = 92 - 9] and  02 = $i - 02, Determine the possible phase-locked states and their stability as functions  of a and b.  4. Instead of the alpha function P(t) in (12.20) suppose that the postsynaptic time course is  given by an exponential function:  k  (-t  P(t)=  exp  Tsyn  VTsyn  What is the phase coupling equation that is produced by this function (i.e. the analog of  12.23)? For both excitatory (k > 0) and inhibitory (k < 0) coupling,determine what phase- locked states are asymptotically stable.  5. Determine the value of rsyn (nearest 0.1 ms) at which IPSPinteractions.m switches from  antiphase to synchronous oscillations. For all simulations let the two stimulating currents  be 1.07 and 1.0. (a) For an inhibitory synaptic strength k = 5, what is the transition value  °f Tsyn? (b) If k = 10, how does the value of Tsyn for synchronization change? Interpret your  results based on synchronization models developed in the text.  204  Spikes, decisions, and actions  6. Use the script LGN2cell.m to explore the conditions on synaptic connection strengths  and time constants necessary for this two-neuron, negative feedback loop to generate  sustained oscillations, (a) For kE = 2, k] = 20, determine the maximum and minimum  values of rsyn (nearest ms) that will support a bursting limit cycle, (b) Keeping rsyn = 40 ms  and A:E = 2, what is the smallest value of k] (to the nearest integer) that will sustain a limit  cycle? Explain your results in terms of underlying dynamical principles.  7. Use LGNsynchrony.m to determine how network parameters affect synchronous  bursting, (a) Let kE = 2, ki = 20, and ku = 4 (the I-I cell synaptic connections). Deter- mine the smallest value of rsyn (nearest ms) that permits synchrony, (b) For the same  synaptic weights, determine the largest value of rsyr (nearest ms) that permits synchrony,  (c) What type of solution is obtained for the following parameters: kE = 2, k\ = 4, and  ku = 20, Tsyn = 40 ms? (Note that this program takes about 2 min to run each simulation.)  13  Swimming and traveling waves  The analysis of phase locking and synchrony in the previous chapter provides a basis for  understanding many motor control systems. One such example has already been dis- cussed: the swimming network of Clione. Indeed, phase-locked limit cycles generated by  neural networks form the basis of virtually all rhythmic motor behavior: breathing,  swimming, running, chewing, etc. (Stein et ai, 1997). Our focus will be on swimming, as  some of the most elegant and thorough analyses of motor control lie in this area. The
