1. Solve for the steady state of the cable equation (15.5) subject to the boundary condi- tions: F(0) = -60 mV and V(2D) = -20 mV. Plot V(x) for 0 < x < 2D.  2. Assuming zero flux boundary conditions, generalize (15.24) to include sine wave terms.  Write down the exact solution to the cable equation when the initial distribution is  V — 2sin(7r.v/2) + sin(57r.v/2) - sin(97r.v/2). Produce an animation of this solution by  modifying the script Diffusion.m.  3. The temporal order of synaptic events can have a dramatic effect on the postsynaptic  potential at the soma. To study this in a passive dendrite, modify Dendrite.m by setting  NumPSP = 3 so that you can incorporate three postsynaptic potentials. Plot the time  course for 10 ms of the following distribution of PSP locations and times (note that the  first event in the program always occurs at ? = 0ms):  (a)x = 40 pm,? = 0ms;.v = 70 pm, ? = 2ms;.v = 100 um, ? = 4 ms.  (b).\= 100 um,? = 0 ms; x = 70 pm,? = 2ms;.v = 40 pm,? = 4 ms.  (c).v = 100 pm,? = 0 ms; .Y = 100 pm,? = 2ms;.v = 40 pm,? = 4 ms.  (d) x = 70 urn, ? = 0 ms; x = 70 um, ? = 2 ms; x = 70 um, ? = 4 ms  Which sequence of synaptic events produces the maximum peak PSP? Which sequence  produces the greatest mean PSP? How would you expect the spike rate of this neuron to  differ in these two cases (assume the threshold is a PSP of 0.45)?  4. The analytical solution for action potential propagation in (15.40) and (15.42) predicts  that spike velocity will be directly proportional to the diffusion length constant D. Using  the script Spike Propagate.m test this prediction for D = 0.4,0.2, and 0.1mm. Plot  simulated velocity as a function of/) to determine whether the relationship is linear.  5. The formula for v in (15.40) also makes an implicit prediction of the dependence of  spike velocity on the Na+ equilibrium potential, £Na. This is because the height of the  action potential, h, is mainly determined by £"Na (see Fig. 9.2). Assuming that  h = 0.88£Na, which is the relationship in our analysis of (15.33), calculate v using (15.40)  for £Na = 0.60,0.40, and 0.25 (i.e. 60, 40, and 25 mV). Fet D = 0.25 mm in each case. Plot  your calculated velocities and compare with the results of simulations using Spike Pro- pagate.m for these same values of £wa (-EWa = 0.55 in the script).  278  Spikes, decisions, and actions  6. Cortical spreading depression is a phenomenon in which a wave of unusually high  extracellular K+ concentration spreads across the cortex at a rate of several mm per  minute. Grafstem (1963) proposed a quantitative biophysical model of this K+ wave that  is described by the equation:  T™=D2^+2K(2.3-K)(9.5-K)  dt  ox- where K is the excess extracellular K+ relative to the resting state. The diffusion length  constant is Z) = 0.02mm, and r = 0.5s. Solve this equation for the traveling wavefront,  graph it, and calculate the velocity of propagation. Convert the velocity to mm/min.  Cortical spreading depression is thought to be the cause of visual auras in migraine  attacks, and these auras spread across the visual field at a rate equivalent to about  3 mm/min on the surface of the visual cortex. How does your computed velocity compare  with this9  7. Reduce the four-compartment model for a neuron with active dendritic ion channels  Na+ in (15.46) and (15.47) to produce a two-compartment Rinzel-type model with  coupling between the soma and dendrite described by (15.48).
