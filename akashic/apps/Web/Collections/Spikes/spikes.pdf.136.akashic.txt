satisfied by dU/dt evaluated along trajectories, then .Y0 is asymptotically stable:  (a) dU/dt is negative definite within R, or  (b) dU/dt < 0 in R, but except at x = x0, all trajectories passing through points  where dt//d? = 0 return to regions where dU/dt < 0.  A state function U satisfying the conditions of Theorem 12 is called a Lyapunov  Function in honor of its discoverer. A state function is negative definite in a region sur- rounding a singular point if U< 0 within R except at the singularity where U = 0.  The Lyapunov function V defines a mathematical valley with Xo as its absolute mini- mum point. Condition (a) of the theorem states that all trajectories will flow down to XQ  like water seeking its lowest point if d U/dt < 0 along these trajectories. Our evaluation of  dU] /dt in (14.6) produced a negative definite function in the (.v. y) plane, so trajectories of  the system in (14.3) satisfy condition (a) of the theorem for any region enclosing the  origin. It follows from the Lyapunov Function Fheorem that the equilibrium point at the  origin of (14.3) is asymptotically stable.  Condition (b) generalizes Fheorem 12 to the case where trajectories pass through  regions where dU/dt = 0 so long as they subsequently re-enter regions where dU/dt < 0.  To complete our metaphor of trajectories as water flowing down the sides of a state space  valley, condition (b) means that trajectories may briefly enter a lake where flow is level so  long as they eventually enter an outlet stream again flowing downhill from the lake.  Recall discussion of the Hopf bifurcation theorem in Chapter 8. The van der Pol equation  (8.13) was analyzed exactly at the bifurcation point where the linearized eigenvalues were  purely imaginary. The equations at this point are:  d.v_  dy~}   2  2   ( R 8 )  — = — UJ x - x y  dt  It is easy to verify that (0,0) is the only steady state and that linearized analysis cannot be  applied because of the pure imaginary eigenvalues. However, the positive definite state  function U = (UJ2X2 + y2) has the time derivative along trajectories:  Lyapunov functions and memory  227  Thus, dU/dt < 0 except on the x and v axes, where dU/dt = 0. When y = 0, dy/dt ^ 0  except at the origin, so trajectories at points where y = 0 must move into regions where  dU/dt < 0. Similarly, when A = 0, d.v/d? f= 0 (again excluding the origin), so trajectories  must again move into regions where dU/dt < 0. This satisfies condition (b) of Theorem  12, so (7is a Lyapunov function for eqn (14.8) in the (v, v) plane, and the steady state al the  origin is asymptotically stable. A Lyapunov function has thus enabled us to prove the  asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point under conditions where a linearized analysis  fails.  Lyapunov functions define a topographic landscape associated with the trajectories of  a dynamical system, and this enables us to develop an even more powerful theorem  concerning asymptotic stability. First recall that the linearized stability analysis embodied  in Fheorem 8 only proves that trajectories originating sufficiently close to an asympto- tically stable steady state will approach it as ? —» oo. However, Fheorem 8 says nothing  about the meaning of 'sufficiently close.' Lyapunov functions remove this restriction  because they define all points of the valley within which the equilibrium point lies.  Intuitively, therefore, you might guess that any trajectories originating within the walls of  the valley would flow downhill to the equilibrium point. This intuition is basically correct,  but to make it precise we must define the domain of attraction or domain of asymptotic  stability (synonymous terms) of a singularity at An.  Definition: The domain of attraction of an asymptotically stable singular point at  xo is the region of the state space defined by the set of all states a, such that if  ,v(?) = fl for any ?, then x(t) —> XQ as ? —> oo.  As trajectories cannot intersect in an autonomous system, the domain of attraction is
