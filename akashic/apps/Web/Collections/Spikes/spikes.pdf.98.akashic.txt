Rinzel and Lee (1987) have shown that the Plant (1981) equations will produce parabolic  bursting if the parameters are modified slightly. To see this, let us increase the time  constants for X and C in (10.3) to 125 ms and 300 ms respectively. This will slow the  endogenous membrane oscillation significantly, thus producing bursts with many more  spikes each. With these modifications eqn (10.3) produces bursting like that shown in  Fig. 10.6, which was obtained from a 2500 ms simulation using ParabolicBurster.m. The  instantaneous spike frequency during the burst is plotted below and shows the char- acteristic parabolic shape of the burst. Thus, parabolic bursting represents a variation on  the theme of interacting Ij and /AHP currents.  10.4 Neocortical bursting  Although bursting neurons were first discovered in invertebrates, such as aplysia, similar  neurons have more recently been discovered in mammalian neocortex. For example,  Fig. 10.4C shows activity from a bursting neuron in mouse somatosensory cortex (Agmon  and Connors, 1989), while Fig. 10.4D shows responses of a 'chattering' cell in cat visual  cortex (Gray and McCormick, 1996). In both these cases, the bursting is not endogenous  but instead must be driven by a constant stimulating current injected into the cell by the  166  Spikes, decisions, and actions  > E  200  400  Time (ms)  50  100  150  200  Time (ms)  250  Fig. 10.6 Parabolic burst of spikes in A and spike rate in B (reciprocal of interspike intervals) from (10.3)  with modified time constants described in the text.  experimenter. However, the bursting still reflects intrinsic membrane properties of these  cells rather than network properties.  As an interplay of /T and /AHP currents also provides the basis for bursting in mam- malian neurons, let us explore a model for them that is derived from (9.10) and is similar in  form to eqn (10.3). The equations are:  dF  d?"  dR _ 1  d7~ 2+  dA_ 1  ~d7~L5  dC_ J_  ~d7~ 56  {17.81 +47.58F+ 33.8F :}(F- 0.48) - 26/?(F+0.95)  1.7A(F- 1.4)- 13C(F + 0.95) + 7  R+ 1.29F+0.79 + 3.3(F+0.38)2)  (10.5)  (-A+9(F+0.754)(F + 0.7))  (-C + 3X)  Neural adaptation and bursting  167  The R variable now has the faster 2.1 ms time constant characteristic of fast-spiking cells  (see Fig. 9.11), because chattering cells have a much narrower spike than regular-spiking  neurons (Gray and McCormick, 1996). The key difference between (10.5) and (10.3),  however, is found in the dA"/d? equation. As it was shown in the last chapter that  V= -0.754 at equilibrium in (9.10), the factor (F+0.754) in the dX/dt equation guar- antees that X = 0 and therefore also C = 0 in the absence of an external current /.  Therefore, eqn (10.5) will remain in the resting state with V = â€”0.754 when / = 0,  guaranteeing that (10.5) cannot generate endogenous bursts.  Let us study eqn (10.5) using a combination of analytical methods and simulations. The  isocline equations are easily obtained, and substitution then leads to the following  equation for the equilibrium points:  485.9F3 + 1056.24F2 + 768.736F+ 187.424 - / = 0  (10.6)  Six-figure precision in this equation is necessary in order to obtain accurate roots. Dif- ferentiation of (10.5) then leads to the following expression for the Jacobian, where V  must be evaluated at the steady state:  I  an  -26(F+0.95)  3.1429 F+1.8086  -0.47619  ^ F + 0.8724
