here, as excellent treatments may be found elsewhere (Hille, 1992; Johnston and Wu,  1995). Rather, we shall examine the simplest dynamical models that can explain two  rather complex neural phenomena: spike rate adaptation and bursting. This will require  incorporation of one or two additional ionic currents into the basic models from the last  chapter, each described by an additional differential equation. This will ultimately lead to  a mathematical taxonomy of single-neuron dynamics as currently understood.  10.1 Spike frequency adaptation  Human neocortical neurons incorporate an /A current, and we saw in the last chapter that  eqn (9.10) provided an accurate description of the shape of action potentials of regular- spiking cells (see Fig. 9.11) and also of fast-spiking neurons (by reducing the time constant  TR. Regular-spiking neurons have one other dramatic dynamical characteristic lacking in  fast-spiking neurons: the spike rate rapidly decreases or adapts during continued sti- mulation (Connors and Gutnick, 1990; Gutnick and Crill, 1995). This results from  activation of a very slow hyperpolarizing potassium current, which is generally mediated  by an influx of calcium (Ca:+) ions. This is frequently termed an afterhyperpolarizing  potential or /AMP- Data from a human regular spiking neuron (Lorenzon and Foehring,  1992) showing spike frequency adaptation are plotted in Fig. 10.1C. Adaptation similar  to this was incorporated into models of short-term memory and neural competition in  Chapters 6 and 8.

The spike train  produced by (10.1) is plotted in A for 7=0.85. Spike rate as a function of time for (10.1) is plotted in B for  /= 1.8. Comparable spike rate adaptation data for a human regular-spiking neuron (Lorenzon and Foehring,  1992) are plotted in C.  The dynamical effects of an /AHP current can be produced by adding an additional K+  current to eqn (9.10) that is governed by the conductance variable H:  dV  cdt  dR  ~d7  dH  ~dt  {17.81 +47.58F+33.8F 2}(F-0.48)  26R(V+0.95) - \3H(V + 0.95) + I  R+ 1.29F + 0.79 + 3.3(F + 0.38):  5.6  - ^ ( - / / + l l ( F + 0 . 7 5 4 ) ( F + 0 . 6 9 ) )  :io.  The most obvious point about this potential is that the time constant for H is 99 ms,  almost 20 times slower than R and 100 times slower than V. Also note that the reversal  potential for this current is V = -0.95 (i.e. -95 mV), the same reversal potential as for K+  in the recovery current governed by R. Finally, we have already seen that V = -0.754 in  158  Spikes, decisions, and actions
