certain nonlinear phenomena, such as chaos, can only occur in systems with three or more  components.) As two-component systems can describe responses of two interacting  model neurons, their responses can be regarded as defining two axes in a plane. This  insight leads to the concept of the state space of a dynamical system, which will be  developed here and employed throughout the book.  3.1 Second order equations and normal form  By definition, a second order differential equation is one which contains only first and  second derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to time ?, but no higher deriva- tives. Without doubt, the most famous second order differential equation ever written is  Newton's (1687) second law of motion, / = ma, where / is force, m is mass, and a is  acceleration. In a typical textbook example of a weight at the end of a spring, the  restorative force f=—kx,  where x is the position relative to the resting length of the  spring, and the air resistance contributes a second force term that is proportional to  velocity. As acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, a = dv/d?, and velocity is the  rate of change of position, v = dx/dt, Newton's second law for a spring can be written as:  d2.v  ,  d.v  m—^ = -kx — r—- or  d?2  d?  (3.1)  d-.v  d.v  ,  m—T + r—- + kx = 0  d?-  d?  Given our focus on neuroscience, it is interesting to note that this same equation pro- vides a simplified description of the contraction of muscle fibers, as will be discussed  below.  Two-dimensional systems  29  Let us now proceed to solve (3.1). Assuming k and r are constants, we may proceed in  the same manner as (2.1) in the last chapter by substituting an exponential function  x = a exp(A?):  .2 .  J  m - 4 + r — + kx = mX2atx' + r\atXl + katXl = 0  (3.2)  d?2  d?  Factoring (3.2), we obtain the following characteristic equation for A:  mX2 + rX + k = 0  (3.3)  This quadratic equation is readily solved to yield:  x =  -r±Vr2-4mk  2m  v  '  Note that (3.4) yields two values, Ai and Ai, that solve (3.1). This means that the general  form of x(t) will be a linear combination of two exponentials:  x{t) = atx<'+ beX2'  (3.5)  where a and b are constants. The particular values of a and b must be determined from the  initial conditions. As there are two constants, there must be two initial conditions for this  second order problem, and these are generally taken to be the values of both x and the  velocity (dx/dt) at ? = 0.  Rather than pursue this example further, however, let us now see how (3.1) can be recast  as a system with two interacting components. All we need do is define a new variable, y,  which we equate to the velocity, d.v/d?, and then substitute this into the first equation in  (3.1). The resulting two-equation system is:  dx  = y  1  f-kx-ry)  I  i  <">  d?  m  Thus, we see that Newton's second law can be re-described by a pair of equations that  incorporate interactions between position and velocity. When a higher order differential  equation is written as a system of coupled first order differential equations, as in (3.6), the  equation will be said to be in normal form. This is a more general definition of normal form  than is employed in some other texts, but it will suffice here. Almost all higher order  differential equations of scientific interest can be written in normal form using the same  stratagem of defining new variables to represent the various derivatives of the function.  To take one third order example, the equation:  d3.x  d2.r  Ax  , .  ^  + acXf+bTt  + cx = g[t)  (3-7)  30  Spikes, decisions, and actions  can be written in normal form as the equivalent system of first order equations:  d.v  d7 = v  (3.8)  d?  d>  d?  — = -az-bv-
