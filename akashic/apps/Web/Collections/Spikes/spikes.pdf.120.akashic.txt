However, the model incorporating (12.26) will generate a burst of  spikes caused by PIR. A model PIR burst is compared with data for an LGN neuron in  Fig. 12.7. Fhe script LGN2cell.m with both synaptic conductance factors equal to zero  reproduces this result.  The interaction between one LGN cell (E|) and one PGN cell (I|) constitutes the next  ingredient in the network dynamics. The script LGN2cell.m contains equations for both  E| and I| with synaptic connections incorporated using (12.19). If you rerun LGN2cell.m  with the excitatory synaptic strength kE = 2 but the inhibitory strength k] = 0, /| will  generate a burst as a result of EPSPs from E|. Running the program again with kE = 2  and A| = 20 now completes the inhibitory feedback loop, and the two neurons generate a  continuing oscillation in response to the initial brief hyperpolarization of E|.

The following sequence of  events cause this oscillation: E| excites F to fire a spike burst, but this leads to strong  hyperpolarization of E] due to IPSPs from I|. As a result, E| generates another burst of  spikes triggered by PIR, and thus the sequence repeats itself.  The discussion of negative feedback in Chapter 4 showed that oscillations generally  require delays in the feedback loop, and the same is true for the interactions between E|  and I|. In the simulation, rsyn = 40 ms, which is within the range typical of GABAb  inhibition in the LGN and PGN (Crunelli and Leresche, 1991 Kim et ai, 1997). Reducing  the synaptic time constant to rsyn = 10 ms and running LGN2cell.m with kE = 2 and  k] = 20 will abolish the oscillation. In this negative feedback loop, therefore, it is the slow  IPSPs that produces the feedback delay necessary to permit oscillations to occur.  The synchronized bursting of the entire LGN-PGN network in Fig. 12.6 can now be  understood. The spike trains in Fig. 12.8 show the result of activating the entire synap- tically coupled network with a brief 50 ms depolarizing pulse delivered to F. As long as  rsyn is in the range 40-70 ms (see Exercise 6), the pulse will trigger an E|-I i oscillation as  described above. The inhibitory interconnections from F to E2 and F cause them to begin  bursting about 300 ms later as a result of PIR. Synchronization among all four neurons is  now achieved as a result of the inhibitory cross-coupling with slow inhibitory time con-
