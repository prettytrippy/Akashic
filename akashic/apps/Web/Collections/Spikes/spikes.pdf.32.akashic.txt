A(0) = 0 and A(0) = 0. Note that the equation for A has been constructed so that A = x in  the steady state, a requirement that any delay must meet. The first equation was solved in  Chapter 2, and the second can also be solved using Theorem 1 with the results:  A ( ? ) = 1  -t~'/T  Alt)  rt-'/T  6t-'/d  r +  r  (4.14)  assuming r^6 (the solution involves critical damping otherwise). Now let T = 10 ms and  Â£ = 5 ms and examine the solutions plotted on the left of Fig. 4.3. It is clear that the  response A lags behind x(t), which is required of a delay. The figure also plots x(t) with a  true 5 ms delay to show that A(?) with 6 = 5 ms provides a modest approximation to the  delay. If a more accurate approximation is desired, one can always include a chain of  additional delay stages in eqn (4.13). For example, with four delay stages one would set  6= 1.25 ms in this case, and the approximation to a true delay is greatly improved as  shown on the right side of Fig. 4.3. In the limit of an infinite number of stages our approx- imation would be exact (see below). Remember, however, that in all computer simula- tions neural time delays are de facto represented by a finite number of stages simply  because computers can only calculate a result at a finite number of time points. Thus, com- puter simulations reduce to embellishments of the delay approximation in eqn (4.13).  Four delay stages  40  50  Fig. 4.3 Solid lines plot approximations to a 5 ms time delay by the introduction of one (left) or four (right)  additional differential stages A as in (4.13). For comparison, an actual 5 ms delay of \(t) (long dashes) is also  shown (short dashes). Additional stages increase the accuracy of the approximation.  Higher dimensional systems  57  For most purposes the addition of one or two delay stages in the manner just described  will permit a satisfactory approximation of delay effects on dynamics. (As emphasized by  MacDonald (1989), however, a very large number of stages is sometimes necessary to  explain all aspects of a true time delay.) Let us return to the feedback system in (4.10) and  introduce a delay before the inhibition I begins to exert its effect. If we let a = 2, b = 8, and  the time constants be 10 ms and 50 ms for E and I respectively, the equations describing  the system become:  (4.15)  The presence of the delay stage A can be represented in a simple neural diagram like  Fig. 4.4. Is there any value of the delay time 6 that will produce an oscillation? The matrix  for (4.15) is:  dE  ~di =  d/  d?~  dA  ~d7"  4<  =*<  -V- -E-2A  -I+ZE)  A + I)  1/10  8/50  0  0  -1/50  \/6  -1/5  0  -\/6  (4.16)  The Routh-Hurwitz criterion in Theorem 7 can be used to solve for 6 by entering matrix A  into the MatLab function Hopf.m (always with G as the unknown), saving this func- tion, and then running Routh_Hurwitz.m. You will find that <5 = 7.61 ms will cause solu- tions to (4.15) to be periodic with a frequency of 0.133, which is 0.133/27T cycles/ms or  21.2 Hz. Thus even a short feedback lag in eqn (4.15) can lead to rapid oscillations.  Oscillations caused by delays in neural transmission may well be one cause of the  tremors exhibited by patients with multiple sclerosis, a disease in which axonal trans- mission is known to be slowed down (Beuter et al., 1993). Indeed, Mackey and Milton  (1987) coined the term 'dynamical diseases' to refer to physiological systems that  become dysfunctional due to alterations such as increased time delays. One cautionary  note: not all feedback loops are guaranteed to oscillate for some value of 6 in eqn (4.15).
