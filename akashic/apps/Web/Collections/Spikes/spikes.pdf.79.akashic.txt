Rushton function. To see that this other form of sigmoidal (i.e. S-shaped) nonlinearity  does not change the general features of solutions, consider the following modification of  (8.2):  dF  1 (  100  F ± - d?  5 V  1 ±exp(-0.1(1.6F-/±/c-40))  d/  1 (  100  /±  d?  10 V  1 ±exp(-0.1(1.5F-40))  (Note that the connection strengths are identical to 82.). Conduct the following analysis  of limit cycles in this system: (a) determine the stability characteristics of the steady state  when K=0; (b) prove that there is a Hopf bifurcation near K= 10; and (c) simulate and  plot results (along with a phase plane plot) for K= 15.  5. Using WTAadapt.m determine the values of 0 (to the nearest 0.1) in (8.20) at which  limit cycles arise and then vanish (you will find two values of 0). Draw the bifurcation  diagram near the higher 0 value and indicate what type of bifurcation this appears to be.  6. The following equations provide a much more accurate description of action potentials  in the giant axon of the squid than do the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations:  0 . 0 5 ^ = -{1.35 ± 3.67K± 2.5K2}(K- 0.55) - 2R(V + 0.92) ± /  d?  j p  i  — = —(-F±1.1F±0.82)  d?  rR  7-R = 1.3 ms  where the time constants are in ms and /is the input current, (a) Give a complete analysis  of all steady states for / = 0. (b) Give a complete analysis of all steady states for / = 0.1. In  this case plot the isoclines and prove that the system must have at least one asymptotically  stable limit cycle, (c) Simulate these equations for 20 ms using input current / = 0.1 and  plot V(t). For initial conditions, start with F(0) and R(0) at their resting values for the  case where / = 0. Indicate what step size you have used to obtain an error estimate that is  < 0.001, and indicate the actual error estimate you have obtained.  9  Action potentials and limit cycles  In the previous chapter we developed criteria for the existence of limit cycles in nonlinear  dynamical systems, namely the Poincare-Bendixon theorem and the Hopf bifurcation  theorem. As one example, we examined the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations, the simplest  approximation to the dynamics of action potentials. However, these equations are not  closely related to physiology, as they fail to include ionic currents and equilibrium  potentials.  We are now poised to study the dynamics of ionic currents underlying the generation of  action potentials in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, where it will be shown that a periodic  spike train is in fact a limit cycle. Following a brief review of the concepts behind the  Hodgkin-Huxley equations, we shall study a set of equations that are simple to analyze  mathematically but that provide a remarkably accurate description of action potentials.  Subsequent topics examine hysteresis in spike generation, a dynamical categorization  of neuron types, and various nonlinear resonance phenomena, including stochastic  resonance.  9.1 Hodgkin-Huxley equations  The Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) equations describe the change in membrane potential or  voltage Fas a function of the sodium (/NJ, potassium (/K). leakage (/|cjk), and stimu- lating (/input) currents across the membrane as well as membrane capacitance C. The most  general form of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations is:  dF  (- " j " = -'Na -IK-  W ± /input  (9.1)  As each current obeys Ohm's law, the current / = g(V- E), where g is the electrical  conductance (reciprocal of the resistance), Fis the voltage across the membrane, and £is  the equilibrium potential of the ion in question computed from the Nernst equation  (2.16). The capacitance C (in micro-Farads/cnr, uF/cnr) arises from the fact that the
