For each value of g, obtain the rate for / = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, and plot  all your spike rates on a single graph as a function of/, (b) Prove that there exists a value of  g for which these equations will only produce a finite number of spikes and then cease  firing for/ < 2. Be sure to indicate your reasoning. (Hint: solve for the value of g for which  the steady state can never reach the value of ['defined by the threshold bifurcation. Then,  prove that this steady state is asymptotically stable.)  2. The simulation of (10.5) in Fig. 10.7 shows bursts of three spikes separated by about  225 ms. Using the simulation in Chattering.m, obtain and plot both the spike frequency  within each burst and the burst frequency for input currents / from threshold up to  / = 1.5. Suggest an explanation for the pattern of results you find.  Neural adaptation and bursting  171  3. Hindmarsh and Rose (1984) have proposed a model of neural bursting using three  differential equations. A slightly modified version of their model is:  — = - F3 + 3 F2 + 0.125 - R - H + I  dt  dR  -—=-R  + 5V2-\  dt  A IT  1  ^ - = ~ 5 0 ( - H + 2(F+1.5))  Give an analysis of the neural bursting produced by these equations. In particular: (a) set  H = 0 and analyze the steady states and solutions of the V and R equations for / = 0.  (b) Determine the response when H = 0 and the stimulus is a 25 ms pulse with amplitude  0.6. Such a pulse is easily produced in MatLab by setting / = 0.6 x (Tme < 25). (c) Using  what you have now learned about the solutions, make a graph of the two-dimensional  state space for // = 0 with isoclines and show plots of any limit cycle trajectories,  (d) Simulate all three equations for constant stimulation / = 0.6 and plot the spike trains  to show that bursting does occur. Provide an explanation of the bursting, being sure to  indicate what type of bifurcation to bursting is involved. This is a further type of neural  bursting (Bertram et al., 1995).  4. In this problem you will predict the results of applying TTX to the neocortical bursting  model in (10.5). On the assumption that TTX poisons the active properties of the Na+  channels, replace the first of the four equations in the model by:  ^ = - { 17.81 + 47.58Frest + 33.8F2 es,}(F- 0.48) - 26R(V + 0.95)  - 1.7A7F- 1.4)- 13C(F+0.95)+/  where Frest = —0.754. (a) Calculate the altered Jacobian and analyze all equilibrium  states and their stability for / = 0. (b) Prove that there is a Hopf bifurcation for Fnear the  resting value and determine the values of V and I at this bifurcation. (Note that there will  be more than one bifurcation point; you must find the appropriate one.) (c) Simulate your  TTX equations and plot F(?) for /just above the bifurcation value. Compare the oscil- lation frequency predicted by the Hopf theorem with your results.  5. The endogenous bursting model in (10.3) simulates both inactivation of ly and /AHP
