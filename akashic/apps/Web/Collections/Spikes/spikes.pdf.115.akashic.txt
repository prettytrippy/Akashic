exhibiting a modest phase lag (about 27r/7) relative to the other. If stronger EPSPs are  produced by setting k = 6, phase locking at 52 Hz is obtained with a shorter phase lag of  about 27r/10. Fhese trends are predicted by the phase oscillator equations (12.15) and  (12 16). Furthermore, (12.15) predicts that phase locking will be impossible if the exci- tatory coupling is too weak. You can verify this by running EPSPinteractions.m with  stimuli of 0.4 and 0.3 but coupling k = 2. Thus, the qualitative predictions of the phase  oscillator model are supported by simulations of two interacting neurons, although  quantitative details differ due to the generality of the model.  The phase oscillator model also predicts that two neurons with inhibitory coupling will  phase lock about 180° out of phase. This can be tested using an inhibitory synapse in  (12.18) by setting £syn = -0.92, which has been done in MatLab script IPSPinter- actions.m. The time constant has been shortened to rsyn = 1 ms in this simulation for  reasons that will become clear shortly. If the script is run with stimulus levels of 1.1 and  1.0, the uncoupled neurons (k = 0) will oscillate at u/| = 118 Hz and UJ2 = \07WI  Synapses and synchrony  193  respectively. Setting the inhibitory strength k = 5 in the program now produces phase  locking at 96 Hz at a phase difference near IT, but weak coupling with k = 2 again fails to  produce phase locking. This phase difference, reduction in frequency, and lack of phase  locking for weak coupling are all predicted by eqns (12.15) and (12.16) if the coupling  coefficient a < 0 to represent inhibition.  12.3 An inhibitory swimming network  Although these examples of two coupled neurons certainly elucidate the nature of phase  locking, it might seem hard to imagine that two interacting neurons could actually pro- duce functionally significant behavior. It is therefore striking that the mollusk Clione  swims by controlling each of two wing-like flaps using just two types of neurons: one for  dorsal flexion and the second for ventral flexion (Satterlie, 1985). Even more striking is the  fact that these neurons are mutually inhibitory, yet they can generate an ongoing oscil- lation in response to a brief stimulus. Figure 12.2A shows the alternation of one spike per  cycle in the antiphase firing of one dorsal and one ventral neuron (Satterlie, 1985). If you  run the MatLab simulation Clione.m with a stimulus of 0.5 and inhibitory coupling  strength k = 9, you will produce the spike trains depicted in Fig. 12.2B. The two neurons  spike in antiphase, each generating one spike per cycle just as in the Clione data. Even  more surprising is the fact that stimulation was only delivered to one neuron for 1.0 ms  1 sec  ^MJUUAJUIJ^L- 50  0  -50  V(t)  50  0  -50  B  _J  I  JLJ  i j  Dorsal  U^  1  LJ  \  Ventral  UJ  I  LJ  \  |  LJ  \  \  LJ- I  LJ  1  1  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  Time (ms)  50  Fig. 12.2 Action potentials in dorsal and ventral neurons controling swimming in Clione.

If  the inhibitory coupling is eliminated by setting k = 0, just one spike will be triggered in the  stimulated neuron, but there will be no further neural activity. The Clione cycle rate (near  1 Hz) is much slower than the simulation, but individual Clione spikes are 50-100 ms in  duration, so all of the model time constants could simply be scaled to fit the data.
