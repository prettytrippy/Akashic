The trigonometric identity sin(.v + y) = cos(.v) sin(v) + sin(.v) cos(v) transforms (12.8)  into:  u)2 - u>] - (</| + ct2) cos(o) sin(0) + (a2 - ct\) sin(rr) cos(0) = 0  (12.9) The condition for asymptotic stability of a phase-locked state may now be determined  from (12.5):  — [//•>(-0) - 7/| (</>)] = -(a2 - a\) sin(cr)sin(0) - (a\ + a2) COS(CT) cos(f/>) < 0  d0  (12.10)  where 0 is a solution to (12.9).  The general solution to eqn (12.9) can be written down (see 12.17 below), but much  insight may be gained by considering several physiologically important special cases. The  first case of interest occurs when the frequencies of the independent oscillators are equal,  uj\ = UJI = UJ. As these frequencies are determined by external signals to the individual  oscillators, it is easy to produce this condition physiologically. Equation (12.9) may now  Synapses and synchrony  189  be solved with the result:  ((a2 - ct\) sin(rj) \  0 = arctan [)  )-L)  (12.11)  \(fl| +  a2)cos(o)j  Assuming that the synaptic delay 0 < a < 7r/2 and that a\,a2 > 0 (i.e. excitatory con- nections), three different solutions to (12.11) may be distinguished:  0 = 0,7r  for ci\ = a2;  0 > 0 for a\ < a2;  (12.12)  0 < 0 for «i > a2;  When a\ = a2 so that 0 = 0, the asymptotic stability condition (12.10) becomes:  -(«, +fl2)COS(cr) < 0  (12.13)  so this is an asymptotically stable steady state in which the two oscillators are synchron- ized. It is easy to show that the other steady state in this case, 0 = 7r, is unstable. In fact, the  periodic nature of the arctan function guarantees that there will be two solutions to  (12.11) in each of the cases listed in (12.12), but only the smaller, asymptotically stable  value of 0 has been listed in the second and third cases.  The remaining solutions to (12.11) in (12.12) will be particularly relevant to the study of  lamprey swimming, as described in the next chapter. In the first case where ci\ < a2, 0 > 0  is an asymptotically stable, phase-locked solution as long as (12.10) is satisfied. For  example, suppose a2 = 2a\ and a = 2TT/25 (4% of a period). Now (12.11) gives 0 = 0.085,  which is 4.9°, and inspection of (12.10) shows that this solution is asymptotically stable for  any values of the coupling coefficients satisfying our conditions. As 0 = 92 — 9\, this  phase-locked solution requires that 82 > 8\, so the second oscillator leads the first in this  case. If coupling strengths were reversed so that ct\ > a2 > 0, it is easy to see that the  phase-locked solution 0 < 0 becomes asymptotically stable. In either case, the frequency  at which the oscillators synchronize is given by the rate of change of phase from (12.2):  d9\  --• = w + ai sin(0 + a)  (12.14)  d?  where wis the common frequency of the uncoupled oscillators. For the particular param- eters discussed above 0 = 0.085, sin(0 + a) = 0.33 so the coupled oscillators lock at a  frequency greater than their uncoupled frequencies. This frequency increase due to  coupling is not surprising given that the coupling, although weak, is excitatory. This  demonstrates that a short synaptic delay in oscillator coupling plus an asymmetry in  coupling strength leads to a phase-locked solution in which one oscillator lags the other  but the oscillation frequency is increased.
