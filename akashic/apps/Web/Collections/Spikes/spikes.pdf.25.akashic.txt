Saccades of 15° and 30° amplitude are plotted by solid and open circles respectively. The two solid  curves plot solutions to (3 29) given by (3.36) for two different values of the equilibrium length .v0.  Eye rotations in the horizontal plane are controlled by a pair of muscles, one of which  rotates the eye to the right and the other to the left. Each muscle is approximately 35 mm  long when the eye is looking straight ahead, and shortening of the appropriate muscle by  either 3 or 6 mm will produce a rotation of approximately 15° or 30° to the appropriate  side. Applying (3.29) first to a 15° rotation, therefore, the muscle will initially be at length  x(0) =35 mm, and the equilibrium length will be 3 mm shorter, so XQ =32 mm. Because  the eye is initially at rest, the remaining initial condition is that the velocity be zero:  dxjdt =0. Based on the data in Fig. 3.5, a = 0.09, which is 1/11 ms. Given these values,  the solution (3.36) to (3.29) is:  0.091  A(?) = 3e-u'w'+0.27?e-UAW + 32  (3.38)  The reader should verify that this satisfies the initial conditions. This result is plotted  in Fig. 3.5 for XQ =32 mm. The agreement of the critically damped solution with the  saccade data is reasonably good given that the biomechanics of eye movements have  certainly been oversimplified here. The figure also shows the solution for XQ =29 mm,  which corresponds reasonably well to the 30° saccade data. The solution in this case has  been relegated to the Exercises.  3.6 Responses to time-varying inputs  There is only one more topic that we must consider to complete our analysis of second  order linear differential equations. This is the case where the system is driven by a time- varying input or forcing function. We saw in Theorem 1 of the previous chapter that  the solution to a first order linear equation was the sum of the solution without forcing  plus a convolution integral that produced a weighted sum of the history of stimulation.  As we shall see, this result generalizes to the second order case as well.  44  Spikes, decisions, and actions  To simplify the derivation, the second order form of the differential equation will be  employed rather than normal form. Consider the fairly general second order equation  with forcing function S(t):  ,2 .  i  -^+(a  + b)-^  + abx = S(t)  (3.39)  d?-  d?  The homogeneous equation is solved by equating the left-hand side to zero and solving the  characteristic equation, which gives A = —a,—b. This is why the coefficients were written  in terms of a and b in the first place. The general solution of the homogeneous equation is  therefore:  x(t) = At~l" + Bt-h'  (3.40)  To find a specific solution to (3.39) that involves S(t), we can adopt the same strategy that  was used above to solve the critical damping problem. This is termed the variation of  parameters approach. Thus, we attempt to find a solution where constants A and B in  (3.40) are replaced by two functions of ?, g(t) and /?(?):  x = gt-'"+ht'h'  (3.41)  As this is only one equation in the two unknown functions g and h, a second equation  must be chosen to fully define the solutions. To obtain a second equation in g and h,  differentiate (3.41):  ^=-agt">-bht-i"+t-'-<d-f  + e - » ^  (3.42)  d?  d?  d?  To obtain a second equation determining the solution, let us require that:
