F = -G (or F = G). As the only term in U that can ever be negative is eFG, reducing the  absolute value of; below that required to make U a perfect square guarantees that £7 will  be positive definite.  To apply Theorem 14 to the divisive feedback network in (14.12). let us equate Fand G  with the right-hand sides of the two equations:  /• = -A +  l+.r  (14.13)  G = - v + 2.v  Note that F = 0 and G = 0 are the isocline equations for (14.12), which is the insight  behind this Lyapunov function method (Wilson and Humanski, 1993). Letting e = 0, the  Lyapunov functions and memory  231  following function is obtained from Theorem 14:  10 \ 2  1  U=2\~X+\+~y)  +2{-y  + 2x^  ( , 4 1 4 )  Because F = 0 and G = 0 are the isocline equations for (14.12 ),U is a positive definite state  function around the equilibrium point at A = 2, v = 4. Because of the definitions of Fand  Gin (14.13), F= dx/d?andG = dy/dt, so the derivative of U along trajectories takes the  form:  — = F ! — + fG — + —  + G V  14.15)  d?  dx  \dy  dx)  dy  A simple generalization of Fheorem 14 shows that any function of the form  aF2 + bFG + cG2 will be negative definite so long as:  From (14.13):  A < 0,  c < 0 ,  \b\ < 2vV  (14.16)  dF  ,  dG  (dF  dG\  10  a.v  a.v  VC'F  <9-v  ( i + y ) - Thus, by (14.16) dU/dt in (14.15) is negative definite as long as y > \f2l> — 1, a value  derived from the third equation in (14.17). This completes the demonstration that U is a  Lyapunov function for the neural system in (14.12) within the region R defined by  v> \ / l 5 - 1.  The Lyapunov function in (14.14) may now be used to obtain an estimate of the domain  of asymptotic stability of the singularity at. v = 2. v = 4 for the divisive feedback system in  (14.12). Theorem 13 indicates that we need only plot contours of the Lyapunov function U  and find the largest one that forms a closed curve surrounding the singularity and lying  entirely within the region R where Uis a Lyapunov function. The program LyapunovFB.m  plots the contours of U from (14.14) as shown in Fig. 14.2. As R is defined by  y> \/(2-5) - 1, this value (y « 0.582) can be substituted into eqn (14.14), and the  minimum value of U(x) determined. This occurs at x « 1.497. Therefore, the largest  contour of U(x, y) that encloses a region lying entirely in R is (7(1.497, 0.582) = 14.54.  This contour defines the region DA in Theorem 13 and is indicated in Fig. 14.2 along with  three representative trajectories of (14.12). Note that DA is actually a very conservative  estimate of the domain of asymptotic stability, which in fact includes the entire first  quadrant. However, DA is the best estimate obtainable from the Lyapunov function in  (14.14).  The approach to constructing Lyapunov functions using Theorem 14 is generally useful  given the flexibility in choosing a value of e such that |e| < 1. In two-dimensional systems  for which linearized stability analysis using Theorem 8 demonstrates the asymptotic  232  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Fig. 14.2 Contours of the Lyapunov function (14.14) for (14.12). The outer contour is an estimate of the  region DA from Theorem 13 that is within the domain of asymptotic stability. Three trajectories of (14.12) are  plotted by heavier lines with arrows.
