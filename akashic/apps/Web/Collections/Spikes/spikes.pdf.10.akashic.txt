Therefore:  x(t) = At •(/10 + 50(1 - e - < / 1 0 \  At / = 0, x = A, so the initial condition will be satisfied if A = 0. This produces the  solution:  A(?) = 50(1 - e - ' / l 0 )  As a second case, let us solve the same equation again but with a different initial condition:  .Y(0) = 70. Now A =10 and  x(t) = 70e •,/1" + 50( 1 - e-' / l 0) = 50 + 20e-' / l u  Both of these solutions are plotted in Fig. 2.1, where it is easy to see that x(t) approaches  the value 50 with a decaying exponential time course. The time constant for this approach  is 10 ms, and it is apparent that the solution has virtually reached its asymptotic value by  ? = 40ms, i.e. within about 4 time constants. This is because e~4 = 0.018, within 2% of  the asymptotic value.  To take another example, let us solve the following equation for .v(0) = 0:  dx _ 1  d 7 ~ 2 0 (  -.\- + 40e -i/20\  Using Theorem 1, we obtain:  A e '/a» + 40 e-,/20 I" e,</20 e-i'/20 dt,  = A c-,/20 + 2r e-,/:o  20  Jo  x t  40  35  30  25  f  20  15  10  5  n  First order linear systems  ' ' '  \  \  r \  •  i  •  i  i  i  i  i  '  40*exp(-t/20)  - _  - ^ X \  ' .

As x(0) = 0, the solution is:  A-(?)=2?e-'/2°  This function is graphed in Fig. 2.2. Note that the response x(t) overshoots the stimulus  S(t) and then follows its exponential decay.  2.2  Cascades of first order equations  There are many physiological circumstances in which one first order differential equation  provides the input to a second, the second to a third, and so forth. Frequently it is assumed  on the basis of experimental evidence that each equation has the same time constant r as  the others. This is known as a cascade of equations, and it generally arises when there is a  chain of chemical steps between an initial event and a final measured neural response. For  example, the electrical response of photoreceptors known as rods in the primate retina are  well described by a three-equation cascade. Let us derive the solution to such a cascade for  the rod with stages x, y, and z obeying the equations:  dx _  1  d?  r  d.v _ 1  d?  T  d r _ \_  d?
