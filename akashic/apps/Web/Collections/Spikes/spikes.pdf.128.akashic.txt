Swimming and traveling waves  213  As in the previous chapter, asymptotically stable steady states of (13.5) correspond to  phase-locked solutions of (13.4). For different values of the frequency differences, Aw„  which are determined by command signals from the lamprey's brain, many different  phase-locked solutions are possible. However, our goal is to find traveling wave solutions.  To determine conditions under which (13.5) has a traveling wave solution, set d0,/d? = 0  and substitute 0 = 0, for all i. This constant phase difference defines a traveling wave. The  resulting equations for the steady state traveling wave then become:  Auj] + cti sin(—0 + o) = 0  AUJ, = 0  i =  AUJN-]  — fla sin(  ,/V-2  (13.6)  Thus, a traveling wave solution requires that the frequency differences AUJ, must vanish  for i = 2, N - 2, so all frequencies must be the same except for the first and last. The first  and last equations in (13.6) yield distinctive conditions for traveling waves, because these  two equations describe the boundaries (head and tail) of the chain of oscillators. Note that  Awi and AWA?-I cannot both be zero unless o = 0 or TT. AS a first traveling wave solution,  therefore, let us choose Au;^_ i = 0 and solve the first and last equations in (13.6) with the  result:  Au>i = —fla sin(—0 + a)  (13.7)  As Awi = UJ2 - uj] = -ad sin(2cr), u)\ must be slightly larger than all remaining UJ, (which  are identical) for a traveling wave solution to exist. This assumes that 2<T < IT, which is  appropriate for synaptic delays between segments. Thus, we have obtained a traveling  wave solution in which the wave moves from the head to the tail, generating forward  swimming in the lamprey. Backward swimming can be generated by setting u>\ = 0 and  again solving (13.6).  The stability of solution (13.7) to the coupled oscillator system (13.5) is determined by  the following Jacobian matrix in which the equilibrium solution 0 = —a has been sub- stituted:  / -fla - b  b  0  V  0  fla  "fla -  b  0  -«a - b aa  0  (13.  b)  where b = ad cos(2cr)  214  Spikes, decisions, and actions  The eigenvalues of this matrix will have negative real parts as long as aa > 0, «d > 0, and  fi < 7r/4. Thus, the traveling wave solution to (13.5) is asymptotically stable.  We have now proved that nearest neighbor coupling between the segmental oscillators  in the lamprey spinal cord can generate traveling waves producing either forward or  backward swimming behavior. All aspects of this swimming behavior are produced by the  segmental oscillators and their coupling within the spinal cord. The lamprey's brain only  needs to send a constant command signal (i.e. a constant spike rate) to all segments to  produce the desired swimming rate plus a slightly larger signal to either the first or last  segment to determine the direction of swimming. The remaining aspect of lamprey  swimming to be explained is the fact that the traveling wave of neural activity in the spinal  cord has a wavelength equal to the body length of the animal. As explored in Exercise 2,  this can be done by choosing appropriate nonzero values for both Auj] and ACJJV-I • Fhe  lamprey spinal cord actually includes both nearest neighbor connections as modeled here  and longer range connections. The role of these longer range connections in producing  traveling waves with a wavelength equal to the body length of the organism is discussed by  Cohen and Kiemel (1993) and Ermentrout and Kopell (1994).  13.3 The swimming lamprey  The mathematical analyses above incorporate all of the principles thought to underlie  neural control of lamprey swimming. Ekeberg (1993) demonstrated this in truly elegant
