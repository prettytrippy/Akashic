point. Compared to Fig. 6.4, however, the firing rate in the asymptotically stable state has  decreased, and the saddle point has moved closer. When A i increases to 36, one node and  the saddle point have coalesced and vanished leaving only the origin as an asymptotically  stable steady state. The node and saddle point coalesce when A\ = 30. (The isocline  equations still have three solutions, but two have become complex conjugates and thus  have moved off the phase plane.) To get a feel for this change, run the MatLab script  100  80  60  40  20  Nonlinear neurodynamics and bifurcations  100  S3  '  AT =24  (64, 64)  yy  //  //  yym, 36)  / /  /  /  1  /  ')  1  /  1  1  *â€”  - 20  40  60  80  100  20  40  60  80  100  Fig. 6.6 Isoclines (6.17) for system (6.14) plotted for two values of A\.

IsoclineMovie.m, which produces an animation showing the gradual change of the iso- clines in (6.17) as Ai increases from 0 to 40.  Thus, the adaptation variables Ai and A2 slowly move the equilibrium point corre- sponding to short-term memory activity toward the saddle point until they meet and  vanish from the phase plane. To corroborate this analysis, let us simulate (6.14) using the  script STMadapt.m. In this simulation, a stimulus K= 50 is presented for 200 ms and is  then turned off. As illustrated in Fig. 6.7, however, the ensuing neural activity outlasts the  stimulus for about 5000 ms until adaptation results in loss of stimulus memory, at which  point neural activity rapidly ceases. A larger adaptation time constant ra in (6.14) would  increase the duration of short-term memory but would also increase the simulation time.  Thus, neural adaptation can lead to forgetting in short-term memory tasks, and indeed  monkeys do forget and make mistakes in delayed response tasks when the delay lasts too  many seconds. Correlated with this behavioral change, firing rates of prefrontal neurons  drop back to baseline levels (Fuster, 1995).  This short-term memory network with adaptation is a very important example of the  insights that can be gained by using arguments from symmetry and taking advantage of  widely different time constants. Doubtless, no two neurons ever have exactly the same  characteristics, but just as obviously, there is only enough genetic information to specify  classes of neurons, so it is reasonable to assume that different members of the same class  will be very similar. By letting Fi = F2 and Ai = A2, analysis of (6.14) was reduced from  four to two dimensions.  In (6.14) there is an extreme difference in time scales, because fluctuations in neural  spike rates are much more rapid than neural adaptation. When there is an extreme dif- ference in time scales, the rapidly changing variables are almost always very near equi- librium, but the positions of the equilibria change very slowly. In this example, the spike  rates Fi and E2 vary rapidly and hence arrive at an equilibrium point determined by the  84  Spikes, decisions, and actions  100  CO  or  Q.  2000  4000  6000  Time (ms)  8000  Fig. 6.7 Response of (6.14) to a brief. 200ms stimulus coinciding with the narrow peak on the upper left.

These adaptation variables change  200 times more slowly than the spike rates, so they can be viewed as parameters that  slowly change the structure of the equilibrium points of the system. As illustrated in Fig.  6.7, the response of the system follows the slowly changing equilibrium points for more  than 5000ms. Then a catastrophe occurs: one asymptotically stable equilibrium joins with  the unstable saddle point and vanishes, so the neural response rapidly drops to zero.
