will cause the system to spontaneously switch from a state of uniform neural activity to a  spatially patterned state. You can verify this by running WCstability.m, which imple- ments (7.22) but with constant spatial inputs P = 31.5 and Q = 32.3 that cause the  Computation by excitatory and inhibitory networks  109  CD  CO c o  a.

Each time the script is run a  5.0 ms pulse of a tiny spatial perturbation, 0.01 COS(27TCJ.Y), is added to P with the spatial  frequency LO (an integer) specified by the user. For low spatial frequencies, u = 0,1,2, the  small perturbation has no effect, and the system decays back to its uniform equilibrium  state. Similarly, for a; > 40, the uniform state is again asymptotically stable. However, for  spatial frequencies in the approximate range 5 < w < 12, the tiny perturbation causes the  system to explode into a spatially inhomogeneous, asymptotically stable steady state,  such that plotted in Fig. 7.12 for w = 8. Note that the program simulates 300 ms of time, so  the 5.0 ms perturbation giving rise to the spatially structured state is long gone before the  instability erupts. It is this spatially structured instability that gives rise to the short-term  no  Spikes, decisions, and actions  memory capabilities of (7.22) as illustrated in Fig. 7.11. These spatial instabilities result  because the linearization of (7.22) takes the general form of (7.26).  In addition to a short-term memory mode, the Wilson-Cowan (1973) equations sup- port several qualitatively different dynamical behaviors. One of these, which was termed  the 'active transient mode', may be observed by running the script WCcortexAT.m, which  uses the parameter values hEE = 1.5, hE] = 1.3. and bu = 1.5 (all other parameters  remaining the same). As illustrated in Fig. 7.13, a brief 5 ms spatial stimulus presented to a  restricted area of the network gives rise to a delayed, but very large, amplification of the  network response. In the case depicted, the E response grows from about 1.0 at the end of  the stimulus period to about 28.0 some 20 ms later. The explanation for this dramatic  response amplification in the active transient mode is that local recurrent excitation in the  network causes excitatory activity to flare up, but this in turn triggers a delayed inhibitory  pulse that subsequently extinguishes the network activity. As will be seen in the next few  chapters, there are mathematical similarities between this network amplification and  action potential generation. Such transient signal amplification was initially proposed to  be appropriate for detection of weak stimuli by visual and other primary sensory cortical  areas (Wilson and Cowan, 1973). Transient amplification generated by a balance of  recurrent excitation and inhibition has been rediscovered and extended by Douglas et al.  (1995).  A third dynamical mode of the Wilson-Cowan (1973) equations produces spatially  localized oscillatory activity. Appropriate connectivity values. bEE = 1.9, bE\ = 1.5, and
