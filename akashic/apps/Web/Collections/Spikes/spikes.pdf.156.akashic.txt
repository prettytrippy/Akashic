For the case of an idealized synaptic input at x = 0, Fourier analysis can be used to  prove that A(u>) = 1 for all UJ. In this case the integral above can be evaluated exactly  (Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 1980), and the result is:  e''lT  (-Tx2\  F(.v,?)=-  ,  exp — r -  15.25  2Dx/f^T  ^\4D2tJ  y  '  It can be verified that this is a solution to the cable equation by substitution back into  (15.5) and evaluation of the derivatives. V(x, t) in (15.25) at first appears to behave rather  strangely when ? = 0. If x — 0, V(0, 0) is infinite, while V(x f 0.0) = 0 everywhere.  However, (15.25) has a very important property that clarifies the situation. This property  becomes obvious if V(x, t) is integrated with respect to x while treating ? as constant:  ,-\pi - ^ - ) d.x = e"'/T  (15.26)  2Dyhi/i  4D2t  Thus, at ? = 0, the area under V(x, t) is unity, and this area decreases exponentially with  time as ions leak outward through the membrane. At ? = 0. (15.25) is therefore an  example of a Dirac (1958) 8 function, which was encountered briefly in the discussion of  time delays at the end of Chapter 4. In the context of dendritic potentials. V(x, ?) in (15.25)  represents the potential change at an idealized synapse where a fixed number of ions have  entered the postsynaptic cell in an infinitesimally small region. Thus, the local potential is  formally infinite, although the total number of ions that have entered is finite as given by  the integral in (15.26).  To see how (15.25) can be used to calculate the effects of postsynaptic potentials dif- fusing passively down a dendrite, suppose that a synapse at point X] is active at t\ and  produces a potential change \\ relative to the resting potential. The appropriate solution  to the cable equation for an idealized infinite dendrite is now:  / e-0-(|)/r  exP(^r-rr.—rr I for ? > ?,  n^)=\2D^Ai-h)/r\^2(t-tV))  " " ^ "  (15-27)  0  for i < i]  This is just (15.25) with the origin shifted to x = A; and the time of the synaptic event  shifted to t = t\. Fhe MatLab script Dendrite.m produces an animation of F(.v, ?) in  (15.27) as the potential change diffuses outward from a local synaptic site. The simulation  incorporates a time constant r = 10 ms and a length constant D = 100 um. In evaluating  (15.27), it is convenient to begin with ? > t\ by a small amount, 10 -s ms in this case, to  avoid problems at i = 0. On the assumption that the soma is located at v = 0, Dendrite.m  permits you to explore (he effect of synapses at various distances from the site of spike  generation. Figure 15.4 plots the relative potential changes at the soma (x = 0) produced  by equal strength synaptic events occurring 25, 50, and 100 urn away.
