brackets vanishes. Reference to (14.34) shows that this can only happen at steady states of  the system. Note that condition (c) on the slope of Sj simply requires that it be a mono- tonically increasing function, a condition satisfied by both Naka-Rushton (for x > 0)  and logistic functions.  Lyapunov functions and memory  245  As emphasized by Ermentrout (1998), the Cohen-Grossberg (1983) theorem is very  general and includes the Hopfield (1984) network and others as special cases. As an  example, let us apply Theorem 16 to the network in (14.28) by identifying T, as a constant,  b,(xj) = -Xj, and tr,, = 1. The Lyapunov function in the theorem requires evaluation of  integrals of the following form:  x—:  d.v = XjSi'ax,)  d.v  100A,  IOOCT  fax,  arctan —  a  V a  14.36)  where 5, is the Naka-Rushton function in (14.28) and the factor of 100 is simply the  maximum value of that function. This result was obtained using standard integral tables  (Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 1980). Given this result, the Lyapunov function of Theorem 16  for (14.28) becomes:  U(x,y)  100A(0.25A)  100 + (0.25.x)  - 100y + 4000arctan(0.025i  100A- + 4000arctan(0.025.v) +  100(0.25.v)2  100y(0.25y)- 100+ (0.25;/  100(0.25y)2  100+ (0.25.v)- 100 + (0.25y;  14.37)  where x and v have been substituted for the variables R] and R2 in (14.28). (Note that  (14.37) must have a constant value -(7(80, 80) = 742.8 added to make it positive definite  throughout the state space.) Contours of U may be obtained from the script  CG_Lyapunov.m and are plotted in Fig. 14.8. Comparison of this figure with Fig. 14.6  indicates that the estimated domain of attraction Z)A obtained using Fheorem 13 is much  larger for the Lyapunov function in (14.37) than for the function in (14.29). Furthermore,  100  Fig. 14.8 Contours of the Cohen-Grossberg Lyapunov function (14.37). Note that this Lyapunov function  produces considerably larger estimates of the domain of attraction, DA, of (14.28) than those in Fig. 14.6. The  contours bounding DA are closed beyond the region shown.  246  Spikes, decisions, and actions  the Cohen-Grossberg theorem guarantees that the system cannot have a limit cycle, as  dU/dt < 0 everywhere except at the steady states. These results indicate the power of the  Cohen-Grossberg (1983) theorem.  Let us now return to analyze the CA3 hippocampal model defined by (14.27). Because  (14.27) is not in the form required by Theorem 16, let us adopt a generalization of the  Lyapunov function in (14.29):  <7 = ^ f > ; + ^ / / :  (14.38)  1=1  where F, is the function on the right-hand side of the /th dR,/dt equation in (14.27) and H  is the right-hand side of the dG/d? equation. Differentiating U along trajectories of  (14.27) yields:  Satisfaction of condition (14.32) defines regions within which the double sum terms will  be small enough so that dU/dt < 0. Similarly, it can be shown that |g + dF,/dG\ < 0.7.  Thus U is a Lyapunov function for any equilibrium state in which R, > 50 for M of the  neurons (32 in this model) and R, = 0 for the remaining neurons.  The relevance of inhibitory feedback mediated by the G neuron in (14.27) may now be  clarified. The model parameters guarantee that all 32 active neurons in a pattern will
