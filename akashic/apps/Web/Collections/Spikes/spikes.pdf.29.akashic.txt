For reference, the most general form of the Routh-Hurwitz determinants for a system  of order Nis:  (4.4)  a2k-i  a2u-2  Note that all of the lower order determinants referred to in Theorem 5 are obtained by  starting in the upper left and considering the successively larger square matrices that are  2x2, 3 x 3 , 4 x 4 , and so on. The convention in (4.4) is that a-s = 0 ifj > Nor ifj < 0. The  theorem has been formulated here so that a0 = 1, where a0 is the coefficient of XN. Many  texts make a0 explicit, although it is trivial to divide through by a0 to obtain the char- acteristic equation used here.  To take an example, A5 in a seventh order system would be:  a,  1  0  0  0  03 a2  a\  1  0  as  a4  03  a2  ai  a-] a^  a5  a4  aj  0  0  a-j  a^  as  (4.5)  52  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Theorem 6 was extremely valuable in determining the stability of higher order systems  before the advent of programs such as MatLab that will compute the eigenvalues directly.  Why, then, would one employ this theorem today? One answer is that the Routh-Hurwitz  criterion is easy to program and may well yield a more accurate result than the numerical  methods employed to find eigenvalues of higher order systems. This is because the  derminants required by Theorem 6 involve simple multiplication, addition, and sub- traction; and the final stability test is just an inequality. More importantly, there is one  application of the Routh-Hurwitz Theorem that can be extremely useful in studying  neural systems. Many neural control systems have evolved to generate oscillations. Two  major examples of such systems are neuronal control of locomotion and respiration.  Accordingly, it will be very useful to determine conditions under which dynamical  equations will generate periodic solutions. For linear systems a criterion for the existence  of oscillations is produced as a by-product of Theorem 6. This is the Routh-Hurwitz  criterion for oscillations:  Theorem 7 (Routh-Hurwitz criterion for oscillations): For the Mb. order system in  (4.1) compute the Routh-Hurwitz determinants in Theorem 6. One pair of  eigenvalues will be purely imaginary and the system will therefore produce a  sinusoidal oscillation if and only if:  Ak > 0 and A v , = 0 for  1 < k < N - 2  Note from Theorem 6 that the final Routh-Hurwitz determinant A,v = 0 as well if the  conditions of Theorem 7 are met. This theorem can also be usefully applied to nonlinear  dynamical systems, as we shall see in Chapter 8.  In addition to determining whether a system will produce an oscillation. Theorem 7 can  be used to determine parameter values where neural networks will oscillate. To see this, let  us go back to the network in Fig. 4.1 and use Theorem 7 to determine whether there is  some strength of the inhibitory synaptic connections in the network that will produce
