The program reveals that G = 3 will generate an oscillation of the  general form:  Ek = ,4e-' + 5 e - " ' + Ccos(5?) + Dsin(5?)  (4.9)  where k= 1,2,3,4. Assuming that ? is in seconds the oscillation frequency is 5/(2TT)=  0.8 Hz, about right for respiration. Here again the Routh-Hurwitz criterion in Theorem 7  has found a parameter value that produces a neural oscillation. As the first two terms in  (4.9) die out with increasing ?, the oscillation occurs on a two-dimensional surface in the  four-dimensional state space of the system. These examples will generalize to nonlinear  neural networks, because Theorem 7 can be employed in conjunction with the Hopf  Bifurcation Theorem (see Chapter 8).  4.4 Feedback with delays  A final, very important example of oscillations in neural systems is related to delays  in feedback loops. The negative feedback loop between horizontal cells and cones  Higher dimensional systems  55  (Chapter 3) generates an asymptotically stable spiral point. Can this network also pro- duce an oscillation? Consider the very general linear feedback network between an  excitatory neuron E and an inhibitory neuron I. The equations are:  d £ _ 1  d?  re  - = -<  dt  V  -E - al)  (4.10)  -I+bE)  For a > 0, b > 0, eqn (4.10) describes a negative feedback loop as illustrated in Fig. 1.3.  The A matrix is easily be seen to be:  ^ U T E -i/n)  < 4">  so the eigenvalues are:  X = JJl + L)Jte-?-4ab™  (4.12)  2 \r E  TiJ  2TETI  As real(A) < 0, all solutions to eqn (4.10) must be decaying exponential functions of time,  and so oscillations are impossible in this two component feedback loop. The reason for  this is that both E and I decay exponentially with their respective time constants, as  required for physiological plausibility. (It is, of course, possible to generate oscillations in  an idealized second order system such as a spring without any frictional resistance.)  Does this analysis indicate that linear feedback systems can never oscillate? To answer  this, suppose that physiological conditions caused a delay (for example, an axonal con- duction time delay) in the feedback loop. To represent such a delay exactly in eqn (4.10),  however, becomes extremely complex. In fact, differential equations with delays are  infinite-dimensional dynamical systems! You can convince yourself of this fact from the  following argument. An /V-dimensional system requires TV initial conditions, one for each  variable at time ? = 0. If there is a delay in the system of say 5 ms, a continuum of values  must be specified between ? = —5 ms and ? = 0 to specify the initial state of the system.  Hence, dynamical systems with true delays become extraordinarily complex, and the  interested reader is referred to discussions by Glass and Mackey (1988), MacDonald  (1989), and Milton (1996).  As a simplified approach to the problem, suppose we take our cue from the fact that  delays increase the dimensionality of a dynamical system. This increase is certainly infi- nite, but let us be modest and introduce just one additional differential equation to  approximate the delay by defining the variable A for delay. Before seeing the effect this  56  Spikes, decisions, and actions  has on eqn (4.10), let us see how an additional equation alters the response of a single first  order equation. Consider therefore:  dx  d7  dA  ~d7  -x +  (4.13)  ( - A + A-)  where 6 will approximate the delay time lag in milliseconds, and the initial conditions
