Distance in microns  2000  Fig. 7.11 Responses of Wilson-Cowan equations (7.22) to 10ms stimulation by a 100pm spatial stimulus  (above) or a 1000pm spatial stimulus (below). These are asymptotically stable short-term memory patterns  maintained by recurrent excitation and inhibition within the network after stimulation has terminated.  supporting this behavior may be revealed by considering a spatial system of linear  equations with all the forms of interconnection present in Fig. 7.10:  dF  7T =  d/  dV  E+  X-T exp(-|.Y - x'\/4)Edx' - I jf  exp(-|.v - .v'|/8)/d.v'  exp(-|.Y - .V|/8)£d.V - ? / * exp(-|.v - .r'|/3)/d.x'  (7.26)  This is the typical form produced by linearization of (7.22) around a spatially uniform  steady state produced by constant input values of P and Q. The spatial summations in  (7.22) have been replaced by integrals here for analytical simplicity. Note, however, that  the space constant for the E-E connections (4) is smaller than that for the F-7 and I-E  connections (8) in agreement with requirement (7.23). Equation (7.26) is an integro- differential equation that is differential in time but integral in space, and its stability  characteristics may be examined by letting Fand /be cosine functions of spatial position  108  Spikes, decisions, and actions  with spatial frequency u>:  E(x, t) = E(t) cos(w.v)  and  I(x, t) = /(?) COS(CJ.Y)  (7.27)  If these expressions are substituted into (7.26) it is now possible to evaluate all of the  spatial integrals because (Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 1980):  exp(  X -  X  O cos(uix') dx  2fjcos(o.'.Y)  1 ± (<7^Y  (7.28)  Given this result. Equation (7.26) is now reduced to the following pair of linear differ- ential equations for F(?) and /(?):  dF  7~  d/  d? :  2F  4/  1 ±  4/  (7.29)  1 ± (8w)~  1 ± (3a.-)- (This approach is equivalent to Fourier transformation of the equations with respect to  .v.) Equation (7.29) is now just a linear second order differential equation with coefficients  that depend on the spatial frequency  / - 1 ±  2  ± (4w)- and the characteristic equation is:  *  \  1 ±(8OJ)- 4  V  (8a;)- A  1 ± ( 3 w ) 2 /  0  (7.30)  The eigenvalues of (7.30) display surprising behavior as a function of the spatial fre- quency u>. For u = 0, (7.27) is spatially uniform, and (7.30) gives A = - 1 . - 3, so the  uniform state is asymptotically stable. Similarly, a s i j ^ oo the eigenvalues approach  A = - 1, - 1 , so any rapidly varying spatial state also decays asymptotically to the resting  state F = 0. / = 0. However, the behavior is very different over a range of intermediate  spatial frequencies: for 0.085 < UJ < 0.22, one value of A becomes positive so that the  resting state becomes an  unstable  saddle point.  For w = 0.15, for  example,  A = ±0.17, -4.03. Thus. (7.26) is unstable with respect to perturbations of intermediate  spatial frequency. (The human visual system is also most sensitive to intermediate spatial  frequencies.)  The connection between (7.26) and the Wilson-Cowan (1973) equations (7.22) can now  be made. Had we linearized (7.22) about a spatially homogeneous equilibrium state, the  resulting linearization would have had exactly the form of (7.26), albeit with different  coefficients (see Appendix to Wilson and Cowan (1973) for details). This leads to the  prediction that certain spatial frequencies of stimulation, even of very small amplitude,
