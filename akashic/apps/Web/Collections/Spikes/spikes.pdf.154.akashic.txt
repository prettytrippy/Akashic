hypothesis that the dependence on space and time could be represented by a product of  functions of v and ?, that is:  V(x, ?) = //(x)G(t)  15.14)  Diffusion and dendrites  257  To show that this assumption solves (15.5), let us substitute (15.14) for I'(x, ?). The result  is:  , dG  , d2H  THJt=D~Gd^-GH  ( 1 5 1 5»  Note that the assumption in (15.14) reduces the partial derivatives in (15.5) to ordinary  derivatives. If the term Gil is moved to the left side and (15.15) is divided by GH, the result  is:  T dG  D2 d2H  G d ? + l = 7 7 d A T  ( 1 5 1 6 )  The left side of (15.16) is now a function only of?, while the right side is a function only of  x. The only way this can possibly be true for all values of ? and x is if each side of (15.16) is  equal to the same constant, which will be called -/3 (the minus sign is convenient, not  essential). Setting each side equal to -/3now reduces (15.16) to two ordinary differential  equations:  T dG  ,  G  d  ,  (15.17)  D2 d'H  '  H d.\- These separate equations for ? and x may now be further rearranged algebraically to  generate the results:  T ~ + ( 1 +/J)G = 0  ' ,  (15.18)  d'H+  % - 0  d^ + Z J ^ - 0  Thus, assumption (15.5) that V = H(x)G(t) reduces the cable equation to the two  ordinary, linear differential equations in (15.18). This procedure is known as separation of  variables, as it leads to separate equations in A and ?. Although separation of variables  might seem like a mathematical trick, mathematicians have proven that the solution to the  cable equation is unique. Given this, Fourier's deep insight that V ~ H(x)G(t) reduces the  cable equation to a unique pair of equations that are easily solved. It will be seen in a  moment that the seemingly arbitrary constant (5 is actually determined by the physiology  of the desired solution.  In order to solve (15.18) we must specify initial conditions, just as in solving ordinary  differential equations. However, the initial condition is now a spatial distribution of  concentrations at ? = 0, V(x, 0) = H(x). In addition, we are again confronted with  boundary conditions, because it is necessary to specify how the ionic concentration or  potential behaves at the ends or boundaries of the cylinder. In arriving at (15.9) above for  258  Spikes, decisions, and actions  the steady state, the cylinder was assumed to extend from x = 0 to x = oo. On the more  reasonable assumption that the cylinder is of total length L and extends from -L/2 to  +L/2, boundary conditions require specification of some functions of V(-L/2, t) and  V(L/2, ?). Fhe way in which these functions are chosen depends on the physiology of the  problem. Suppose that we wish to solve (15.18) for the case where the chemical cannot  diffuse through the ends of the cylinder. Fhis is equivalent to specifying that the flux is  zero at the end points, termed a zero flux boundary condition, so:  H H  — = 0 forA = ±L/2  (15.19)  d.v  Solving the second equation in (15.18) gives:  //(A) = .4COS(X/3^)  (15.20)  where A is an arbitrary constant (sine terms can also be included, see below). In order to  satisfy the zero flux boundary condition (15.19), it is necessary to choose 0 to produce an  integer number of cycles n of the cosine function along the length L of the cylinder:  S-I-2-Y  (15.2,  Thus, the boundary conditions constrain 0 to assume only discrete values determined by  the integer n. With this value for b, (15.20) becomes:  //  i - . . i l 2 ^ ]  i: ::  where the subscript on A„ indicates that a different value of this constant may be chosen  for each n.
