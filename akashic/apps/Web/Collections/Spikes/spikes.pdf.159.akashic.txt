the steady states are found to be: (0, - 0.704), (0. - 0.692). and (0, 0.484). Linearized  stability analysis reveals that the first and third of these points are unstable saddle points,  while the intermediate one is an asymptotically stable spiral point. The isoclines of (15.34)  are plotted in Fig. 15.5 using the critical value of v to be derived presently.  As indicated in Fheorem 17, there will be a traveling wave solution to (15.33) if there is a  critical value of the velocity v that results in a heteroclinic trajectory connecting the first to  the third of the equilibria of (15.34). Let us therefore consider the equation for a trajectory  in the phase plane, which is obtained by dividing the two equations in (15.34) to obtain a  single equation for d W/dV:  dIF  (17.81 + 47.71 V+ 32.63V2)(V- 0.55) + 2.288(F+ 0.92)  0.8v  = -  -A  ( 1 5 3 5 )  dF  Eft IV  D-  [  '  The cubic expression on the top can now be written as a product of the three roots  determined by solving the isocline equations:  dW  32.63(F+0.704)(F+0.692)(F- 0.484)  0.8r  dT =  ~D^V~  ~ + -fr  (15'36)  This cubic differential equation has the following general form:  dW _a(V-r)(V-s)(V-h)  bv  dV  D2W  D-  [  '  where /-, s, and It represent the resting steady state, stable steady state, and highest steady  state respectively.

The heteroclinic trajectory moves from  point at /â€¢ to the one at h. This trajectory defines the leading edge of the propagating action  FitzHugh (1969) published the solution to (15.37) describing action potential propa- gation, and in a different context Grafstein (1963) credited the solution to unpublished  work by Huxley (see Exercises). Based on that work, let us prove that the solution to  (15.37) is:  IF:  -A(V-r)(V-h)  (15.38)  Thus, IF is a parabola that originates at the resting equilibrium point r and terminates at  the highest equilibrium point h (see Fig. 15.5). The constant A is not arbitrary and will be  determined as part of the solution. Calculation of d Wjd Fand substitution of (15.38) into  (15.37) yields:  Algebraic rearrangement of this equation leads to the expression:  (-2A2D2 +a)V=  -A2D2(r + It) + as + Abv  [15.39)  The left-hand side of this equation is a function of V, while the right-hand side is just a  collection of constants. The only way that (15.39) can be true for all V, therefore, is if A  and v are chosen to guarantee that each side vanishes identically. Equating the coefficient  of Fto zero and the right-hand side to zero produces two equations that are easily solved  for A and v:  1  A = D  and  D(h + r-2s)  fa  b  V2  ; 15.40)  266  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Note that A and therefore v can be either positive or negative, depending on the sign of  s/(a/2): positive signs correspond to leftward motion and negative to rightward. This  determines the unique values of A and v that produce a traveling wave solution to (15.34).  The parameter values are easily determined by comparing (15.37) with (15.36):  a = 32.63; A = 0.8; r = -0.704;.? = -0.692; and It = 0.484. Choosing a plausible value
