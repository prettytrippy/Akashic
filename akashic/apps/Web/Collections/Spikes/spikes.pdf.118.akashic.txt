Van Vreeswijk et al. (1994) developed an elegant expla- nation of excitatory and inhibitory phase locking that shows how 7-syn governs the stability  of phase-locked solutions. As developed above, the phase oscillator model makes the  assumption that synaptic interactions can be described by an instantaneous pulse with a  synaptic delay a. This assumption is implicit in the description of 77(0) in (12.6). However,  it is evident from the various alpha functions plotted in Fig. 12.1 that this approximation  is reasonable only when rsyn is very small. For large rsyn the resultant synaptic con- ductance change will extend not only throughout one cycle of the oscillation, but it may  produce a long enough tail to extend across many cycles.  Van Vreeswijk et al. (1994) sought to retain the simplicity and elegance of the original  phase oscillator model while improving it by incorporating the effects of synaptic con- ductance changes that persist over time. Fhey chose the following alpha function P(t) to  describe the time course of postsynaptic effects:  Vsyn,  where k is the synaptic strength, being positive or negative for excitatory or inhibitory  synapses respectively. The factor (1/Ts 2 yn) guarantees that the area under the alpha  function will be unity for all values of rsyn. Equation (12.20) can be derived from (12.19) by  removing the step function from the df/dt equation and replacing it with appropriate  initial conditions (see Chapter 2)_. A new phase interaction function 77syn(</>) can now be  computed from the sin(</>) interaction function of the phase oscillator model in (12.6) by  convolution with P(t) (see Chapter 2):  H,yM=Arl  sin(27rW(0-/))?expff^-)d'  ( 1 2- 2 r  'syn JO  \t"syn/  This formula states that if the effect of an instantaneous pulse is given by the simple  periodic function sin(27rur/>) with frequency UJ, the effect of a synaptic potential produced  by (12.20) is computed by integrating it across an infinite number of cycles of the oscil- lation. The integral in (12.21) can be solved exactly using integral tables (Gradshteyn and  Ryzhik, 1980) or a symbolic mathematics program with the result:  k{\ - (2itujTSyn)1\sm(2TTuj(t>)-4-itkujTsv„cos(2iTuj(j))  „ , . , ,  HwW  =  7——  -r=  :  (12.22)  [1 + (2ITUJTSV„) \  The basic phase oscillator equation (12.3) shows that we need to evaluate [77syn(—0)- Hsyn(4>)}. Substituting (12.22) instead of (12.6) into (12.3) yields:  df>  d7  -2k 1 — (2vTWTsyn)" sin(27ra;<?  + (2TTUJTSV„)2\  where it has been assumed that uj] = UJ2 = UJ.  ' 12.23)  198  Spikes, decisions, and actions  So long as 27rursyn == 1, it is apparent from inspection that the equilibrium states of  (12.23) occur for 0 = 0, n. To determine the stability of these states, we must compute the  one-dimensional Jacobian by differentiating the right-hand side of (12.23) with respect to  0 and evaluating the result at 0 = 0, tr. This calculation shows the synchronized state  0 = 0 to be asymptotically stable if:  -k[l - (2irujTsyny\ <0  (12.24)  For inhibitory coupling k < 0, so synchronization will occur if:  Tsyn>~]-  (12.25)  2TTUJ  Thus, inhibitory synchronization results when the synaptic time constant is large, thus  causing a slow conductance change. Inhibitory coupling only leads to asymptotic stability  at phase 0 = n if the inequality in (12.25) is reversed, indicating that the inhibitory
