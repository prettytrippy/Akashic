It should be  emphasized that while the steps involved in obtaining (10.6) and (10.7) only involve simple  algebra and differentiation, this is a case where the reliability of a symbolic mathematics  program such as MathView, Maple, or Mathematica is extremely helpful in avoiding  errors.  If you solve (10.6) for 1=0 using the MatLab roots function and then analyze the  stability of the only equilibrium point, which occurs at V = -0.754, you will find that it is  an asymptotically stable node. As (10.5) is a four-dimensional system in which we seek  spike-producing limit cycles, it is natural to look for a Hopf bifurcation, and the input  current / is the natural variable to choose for the analysis. This is a case in which the  problem can be solved in reverse: first Fis treated as a parameter in (10.7) and the Routh- Hurwitz criterion is used to determine the value of V at which two roots are pure ima- ginary. Equation (10.7) for A has been entered into the function ChatteringHopf.m, and  this can now be solved by running the script R_Hchatter.m which gives F = -0.7017 as  the bifurcation value.

The program finds that the four eigenvalues are A = -7.14,  -0.16, and Â±0.0453i. Thus, the system satisfies the Hopf Bifurcation Theorem 11, and the  emergent limit cycle of( 10.5) begins with frequency (0.0453/27r) x 1000 ms/s =7.21Hz.  Substitution of the bifurcation value V= -0.7017 back into (10.6) now shows that  / = 0.197 nA is the input current at which the bifurcation occurs.  This mathematical analysis can be corroborated by running the script Chattering.m  with a range of / values in the vicinity of / = 0.197. If you then run Chattering.m with  / = 0.3, you will obtain the sequence of bursts plotted in Fig. 10.7. As you can see. this has  the characteristics of spike trains from the chattering cell and the mouse somatosensory  neuron shown in Fig. 10.4C.D. In particular, spike height decreases after the first spike in  the burst, there are a small number of spikes per burst, and each burst is terminated with  an afterdepolarization (ADP). It is interesting to explore the effect of different current  intensities on both the burst frequency and the number of spikes per burst.  This mathematical analysis of eqn (10.5) for a chattering cell reveals that the system will  undergo a Hopf bifurcation with an initial frequency of 7.21 Hz when / = 0.197. To  complete analysis of (10.5), it is necessary to demonstrate that these slow membrane  Neural adaptation and bursting  169  potential oscillations above the Hopf bifurcation achieve sufficient amplitude to push the  spike-generating apparatus in the fast V and R equations back and forth through their  saddle-node bifurcation. Demonstrating this analytically is extremely difficult, so let us be  content to show that it does indeed occur using the simulation of (10.5) in Chattering.m.  The A-C projection of the four-dimensional state space plotted in Fig. 10.7B for / = 0.3  shows that these two variables do indeed produce a limit cycle that drives the V and R  equations through their saddle-node bifurcation into a spiking regime and back again.  Note that the X-C oscillation is coupled to spike generation via V so this is not a simple
