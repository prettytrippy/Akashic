developed below reproduces the key features of their model in simplified form.  In developing a compartmental model, the first question must always be: how many  compartments are necessary? Mainen et al. (1995) used approximately 275 compartments  to simulate the dendritic tree of a particular rat layer 5 pyramidal cell. As this resulted in a  model with approximately 1000 coupled nonlinear differential equations, it will be  necessary to use a greatly reduced number of compartments here. Recently, Bush and  Sejnowski (1993, 1995) have developed a method permitting as many as 400 compart- ments to be reduced to eight or nine, and in another context Destexhe et al. (1996) have  shown that models with as few as three compartments can reproduce many results  obtained with 230 compartments. Accordingly, let us develop four-compartment model  to study dendritic action potentials. The model consists of a soma compartment (assumed  to include the axon hillock) and a chain of three dendritic compartments as illustrated in  the top inset in Fig. 15.7. Each compartment will be assumed to contain both Na + and K+  currents as described the cortical neuron equation (9.10). To further simplify, the con- ductances g between compartments in (15.45) will be assumed to all be identical; g = 4  provides reasonably accurate results. Thus, the equations for the soma will be:  —  = -{17.81+ 47.58Vi + 33.W]}(V]  -0.48)  d?  -26R](V]  +0.95)+I+4(V2  - F,)  (15.46)  — i = — ( - Ri + 1.29F 1+0.79 + 3.3(F, +0.38) 2)  The soma (compartment 1) is only coupled to one dendritic compartment, so only one  coupling term appears in the first equation. Note that coupling only occurs through  current flux between compartments, so only the V] equation is coupled to the dendritic  potential V2.  In writing equations for the dendritic compartments, we must take account of data  indicating that dendritic Na + channel densities are much lower than those at the axon  hillock (lumped with the soma in the current model) (Mainen et ai, 1995; Stuart et ai,  1997). Were it not for this important difference, the dendrites would be essentially  identical to the axon hillock. Making the simplifying assumption that both Na+ and K+  conductances in the dendrites are 0.05 times those in the soma, the equations for the  dendritic compartments become:  ^ = - 0 . 0 5 ( 1 7 . 8 1 + 4 7 . 5 8 F A - + 33.8F 2}(F t - 0 . 4 8 ) - \.3Rk(Vk  + 0.95) + I  dt  + 4 ( F , _ , - F , ) + 4 ( F , + 1 - F l . )  (15.47)  ^ - = — ( - / ? , + 1.29F, + 0.79 + 3.3(F, + 0.38)2)  d?  5.6  for k = 2,3,4 (the second coupling term being dropped when k = 4).  270  Spikes, decisions, and actions  > £  20  0  -20  o  °-  -60  -80  1  1  Soma Stimulation  U=a Dendrite  J  .
