Reciprocal inhibition without a source of excitation can thus produce an antiphase  neural oscillation provided that the neurons involved exhibit PIR and the IPSPs are  sufficiently brief, being of about the same duration as the spikes themselves. These  physiological conditions are fulfilled by Clione (Satterlie, 1985) and by our model. Note,  however, that inhibitory coupling between two neurons described by (12.18) will not  produce ongoing swimming, because these neurons do not exhibit a PIR. This is a con- sequence of the shape of the isoclines in the phase plane shown in Fig. 9.9.  This unusual mode of PI R rhythm generation was predicted by Perkel and Mulloney in  1974 based on mathematical simulations. So here is another example in which nonlinear  dynamics produced a counter-intuitive prediction that was subsequently verified by  neurophysiologists. Spike generation via PIR has also been observed in mammalian and  human neocortical and thalamic neurons (Foehring and Wyler, 1990; Crunelli and  Leresche, 1991; Silva et ai, 1991), and its role in sleep synchronization will be examined  shortly. A final note on Clione: as the resting state is asymptotically stable throughout the  swimming cycle, hysteresis switching can occur between the swimming limit cycle and  rest. Such switching requires a relatively slow external inhibitory input, however, as rapid  inhibition would simply reset the phase of the oscillation. Thus the Clione swimming  mechanism has a form of short-term memory built in.  196  Spikes, decisions, and actions  12.4 Inhibitory synchrony  Thus far, neural simulations have verified the predictions of the phase oscillator model.  However, the phase oscillator model does fail in some surprising ways. If EPSPinter- actions.m is run with f = 0.7,12 = 0.65, and synaptic strength k = 8, the two neurons will  phase lock at 182 Hz (well above the free running frequencies as expected), but phase  locking will be in antiphase with a lag near tr. So much for excitatory interconnections  causing neural synchrony! There is one final surprise in the analysis of phase locking. Up  to this point, inhibitory coupling has caused phase locking about 180° out of phase, and  this is crucial to the functioning of the Clione swimming network. However, several  neural modeling studies have demonstrated that near perfect synchronization is actually  more typical of reciprocal inhibition (Lytton and Sejnowski, 1991: Wang and Rinzel.  1992, 1993; Traub et ai, 1996), and reciprocal inhibition appears to be the physiological  basis of synchronization in a number of systems (Aram et ai, 1991; Steriade et ai, 1993;  Kim et ai, 1997). To see that reciprocal inhibition can lead to synchrony, change the  inhibitory time constant to rsyn = 2 ms in IPSPinteractions.m and run the program with  I] = 1.1, 7> = 10, and synaptic strength k = 5. Whereas out-of-phase oscillations were  obtained above when rsyn = 1 ms, the longer synaptic time-constant produces the almost  perfect synchrony evident in Fig. 12.4. (The very slight phase lead of the top neuron is due  to its stronger input current; it vanishes if f = 1.05.)  What can explain the counter-intuitive observations that reciprocal excitation may  produce antiphase locking, while reciprocal inhibition may result in synchrony? Wang  and Rinzel (1992, 1993) found that slow synaptic conductances plus PIR were sufficient  to produce inhibitory synchrony. However, the inhibitory synchrony evident in Fig. 12.4  occurs between two neurons described by eqn (9.10), so neither exhibits PIR. Thus, the  time course of the synaptic conductances seems to be the prime determinant of inhibitory  20  0  20  -40  -60  0 V  1C  20  1  -20  - •40  -60 I  -B0 1- |  V  2(  .  j J  i  i  i1  I'M  1  i'  ' i  '  •  J  J•  '  30  iC  so  so  -':•  •>:  v.  • :  Time ''TIS;  ,  _j  J  y  J  y  J  y  J  y  .  ^- 0  10
