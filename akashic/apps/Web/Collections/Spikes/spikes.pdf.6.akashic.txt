(1.8)  In this expression, /and its derivatives are evaluated at t = a, and h = t - a is the distance  from a. The first two terms on the right of (1.8) describe the straight line tangent to/at  ? = a, while the next term represents the curvature of/. This formula will enable us to  simplify nonlinear functions so as to gain insights into their properties, and the formula  will also be instrumental in our development of computer approximations to the solutions  of nonlinear differential equations.  To derive (1.8), suppose we wish to approximate a function/?) near t = 0. One of the  simplest approximations is a polynomial in t. So, let us approximate/?) as:  /(?) w a + bt + ct2 + higher powers  (1.9)  To determine the coefficients a,b,c, etc., let us choose an approximation that has  derivatives identical to those of/at point t = 0. First we evaluate both//) and our  polynomial at t = 0, with the result/0) = a. This guarantees that/?) and our polynomial  have the same value at ? = 0. Next, we differentiate both/?) and the polynomial and then  evaluate both at ? = 0. This gives:  J. = b + 2ct = b for? = 0  (1.10)  d?  Similarly, taking second derivatives of both sides of (1.9) and evaluating them at ? = 0  gives:  K= 2 f  (1.n,  If we now replace a, b, and c in (1.9) by the values obtained from (1.10) and (1.11), we  obtain the polynomial approximation to/?):  /?) « / 0 ) + ^ P ? + ^ ^ - p ^ r + higher order terms  (1.12)  This polynomial is called the Taylor series approximation to/?). It is easy to generalize  this approach to show that the «th term must be:  „thterm = I « r -  (1.13)  n\ dt"  v  ;  8  Spikes, decisions, and actions  As one simple example, note from eqn (1.2) that the derivative of e' is 1 at ? = 0, and  indeed all derivatives of e' are also equal to 1 at ? = 0. So the Taylor series for e' to fourth  order near ? = 0 is just:  ^•+'444  (L14)  Although this gives the exact value of e' only at ? = 0, it is still reasonably accurate at  ? = 1, where it produces e « 2.7083, within 0.5% of the true value.  1.3.3  Imaginary exponents  A final aspect of exponential functions that will be of importance in our study of dif- ferential equations is expressed by Euler's formula:  e"" =cos(a?) + /sin(a?)  (1.15)  where ;' = \f—\. In other words, e with an imaginary exponent is equivalent to a com- bination of sine and cosine functions. Based on this equation, we shall see that sines and  cosines provide a foundation for understanding neural oscillations.  A simple derivation of (1.15) can be sketched out based on Taylor series. Let us  approximate exp(/a?) near ? = 0 by a fourth order Taylor's series:  (at)2  .(a?) 3 , (at)4  /——  ~i  24  p-^ViU-tf  The second step is simply a grouping of the real and imaginary parts of the series sep- arately. If you now compare the series for the real part of (1.15) with the Taylor series for  COS(Q/), you will discover that they are identical. Similarly, the imaginary part of the  Taylor series expansion in (1.1 5) is identical to the Taylor series for sin(a?). This sketches  a proof of (1.15), although more sophisticated proofs are available from complex variable  theory.  1.4 Neurobiology background  In addition to the calculus concepts outlined above, this book assumes that the reader has  some basic knowledge of neurobiology. This background is contained in several excellent  introductory texts, such as Neurobiology by Shepherd (1994), Neurons and Networks by  Introduction  9  Dowling (1992), or Foundations of Neurobiology by Delcomyn (1998). In this respect.  Spikes, decisions, and actions is analogous to the many applied mathematics texts written  for physics students. Those books choose their mathematical examples on the assumption
