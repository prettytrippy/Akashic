Fhe equations in (13.1) represent two neurons described by the Naka-Rushton  function (2.11) (recall that the brackets [ ]+ equal zero when the enclosed argument is  negative). The brainstem input \s AE, and the parameters g and TH (defined below in 13.3)  represent the gain and time constant of the /AHP currents for both neurons. As will be seen,  both g and TH are dynamically altered through serotonin modulation.  Although this network is eight-dimensional when both sides are considered, the prin- ciples underlying its operation are easy to understand. If you run MatLab script  Lamprey.m with a stimulus A = 7, you will obtain the results plotted in Fig. 13.2B. Bursts  of spikes are alternately generated by EL and £R, and each burst begins at a high rate and  then decays as the slow /AHP current produces spike rate adaptation. A function  Make_Spikes.m has been used to approximate the individual spikes corresponding to the  continuous spike rate variable £R, and these are illustrated in Fig. 13.2C.  From the shape of the bursting pattern, one might conjecture that it is the /AHP currents  which cause the termination of each burst, as there can be no inhibition from the other side  of the animal when those cells are silent due to suppression by the contralateral C neuron.  This can be verified by running Lamprey.m again after first setting the variable Ginhib = 0  (it lies between rows of asterisks) in the program. This simply cuts off the contralateral  inhibition entirely, so the left and right halves of the network become independent. With  the input A = 7, the bursting pattern in Fig. 13.2B is again observed, except that EE and  £R now burst almost in phase (the slight phase shift results from a small bias in the initial  conditions). This will be even more obvious with a somewhat stronger stimulus, such as  A = 10. This decoupled half of the lamprey segmental oscillator is sometimes called a half- center to indicate that it controls one of two opposed sets of muscles and inhibits the  neurons controlling the other set.  As one side of the oscillator will burst even when decoupled from the other, (13.1) can  be reduced from eight variables to just two: EE and HE\_. The CE neuron can be eliminated  from consideration along with its /AHP current because its output now has no effect on any  other cell in the decoupled network. Under these conditions, (13.1) reduces to:  d£L  _  \00[AL + 6EL]  9 —— = —Ei_ + - d?  '  (64 + gHELf + [AL + 6EL  dHEL  1  '13.  d?  TH  :-HEL  + EL)  These equations can now be analyzed using phase plane techniques (the phase plane is  plotted in Fig. 2 of the Lamprey.m MatLab output). Summarizing the results of such an  analysis for 2 < A < 17 (approximately) there is a single steady state that is an unstable  spiral point. Due to the nature of the Naka-Rushton function in (13.2), 0 < EE < 100, so  the same limits must be true for HEE which is driven by EE. Fhe Poincare-Bendixon  theorem (Theorem 10) can now be used prove that (13.2) must possess an asymptotically  stable limit cycle for this range of A values.  It is notable that the limit cycle for an isolated half of the lamprey is based on principles  analogous to the Wilson-Cowan (1972) oscillator discussed in Chapter 8. In both oscil- lators recurrent excitation drives the upswing at the beginning of each burst. Following  this, recurrent inhibition driven by the excitatory activity terminates the bursting in the  210  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Wilson-Cowan (1972) oscillator, and an analogous role is played by the slow but
