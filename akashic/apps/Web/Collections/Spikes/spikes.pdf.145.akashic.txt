viding input to CA3 are believed to contain networks that minimize overlap between  patterns to be stored in CA3 (Rolls and Treves, 1998).  Lyapunov functions and memory  241  Let us now see how Lyapunov functions can be used to prove that the stored patterns  are asymptotically stable steady states of the dynamical equations (14.27). For simplicity,  let us first focus on the two-neuron short-term memory system developed in Chapter 6. In  the present context, these neurons are assumed to have formed mutually excitatory  connections through previous modification of Hebb synapses. The resulting equations  are:  , djRi  100(0.25/?,)-;  10 — - = -R] +  i  i l + = F t R R  d?  o2 +  (0.25R2)2 +  dR,  100(0.25/?,):  10 — ^ = -R,  +  - i - = F,  (R],R,  d>  (T- + (0.25/v,);  '14.28  The modified strength of the Hebb synapses in this case is 0.25, and <r= 10 as in (14.27).  The function designations F| and F2 simply provide a convenient means of referring to the  right-hand sides of these equations. It is easy to show that these equations have three  equilibrium points at (0.0), (20,20), and (80, 80). To find a Lyapunov function for (14.28),  let us choose a state function in agreement with Theorem 14 that is positive definite about  each equilibrium point:  U = \(F] + F\)  (14.29)  where F] and F2 are defined in (14.28). The derivative of U along trajectories of (14.28)  may now be calculated to be:  dU  „,  „,  „ „ fdF]  dF  dt-^-^  + ^AdRf+dRj  (1430)  The right-hand side of this expression is again in the form in Theorem 14, except that the  right-hand side has been multiplied by - 2 . Therefore dU/dt  will be negative definite  throughout any region where the following is satisfied:  OF]  dF,  „  dR2 +W]<2  ( 1 4 3 1 )  Note that the absolute value sign is not necessary here, as both partial derivatives must  always be positive or zero from the definitions in (14.28). A sufficient, although slightly  conservative, condition for (14.31) to be satisfied is:  dF]  ,  dF,  ,  d<[ and m <[  (1432)  242  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Both partial derivatives can be evaluated directly from (14.28) using (6.10). In the first  case in (14.32) the result is:  dF]  25o2R2  2  \(0.25R2)2+o2 T < 1  (14.33)  A plot of (14.33) is shown by the dashed line in Fig. 14.6B, where it is evident that the  inequality is satisfied both for R2 > 48.5 and for R2 < 8 (regions shaded in gray). Iden- tical considerations apply to the second inequality in (14.32).  Let us now put all these considerations together. Figure 14.6A plots contours of the  positive definite state function f7from (14.29), and a three-dimensional surface plot of U  is illustrated in Fig. 14.7. The MatLab script LyapunovCA3.m produces an animation of  the 3D surface representation rotating to provide a better feel for its shape (Uhas been  100  3  100  200  150 - 100  Fig. 14.6 Contour plot (A)and cross-section (B)of the Lyapunov function?' in (14.29) for (14.28). Gray regions  indicate where AVjdt < 0, and the heavier marked contours show the estimates of DA from Theorem 13.

This positive  definite state function has three minima, one at each equilibrium point of (14.28). Within
