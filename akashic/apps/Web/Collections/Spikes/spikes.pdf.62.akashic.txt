As the maximum possible values for F and / are both 100 given the form of 5„ the  following two inequalities will be sufficient to guarantee that no spatially uniform steady  state can exist in the network:  100(2/3EEaEE - 2/3IEcrIE) < 9E  lOO(2/3E,crEI-2/3„<7„)>0,  where the constants 0, are the semi-saturation constants of the S, functions in (7.21). The  first of these inequalities guarantees that the maximum amount of recurrent excitation in  the network can be overcome by the strength of recurrent inhibition and driven below the  excitatory semi-saturation value 0£. The second inequality in (7.25) guarantees that the  excitatory input to the inhibitory neurons will drive the inhibitory neurons above their  semi-saturation value 0/. Thus, network inhibition will ultimately drive any uniformly  excited state down to the resting state.  Despite choosing parameters that preclude the existence of any uniform activity states,  the Wilson-Cowan equations exhibit a wide range of dynamical behaviors. To demon- strate this, let us first fix the spatial and temporal parameters at the following plausible  values: ? = 10 ms; aEE = 40 pm; o\E = crEi = 60 um; nu = 30 urn. Notice that these values  satisfy (7.23). In addition, the semi-saturation constants in (7.21) will be assigned the  values 0E = 20 and 0] = 40. Finally, it will be convenient to reduce the number of  remaining parameters by requiring AIE = bE\. The three remaining connection strengths,  bEE, bEi, and bu will always be chosen to satisfy inequalities (7.25).  As the simplest example to understand, let us first consider the short-term memory  mode of (7.22), which can be produced by the parameter values bEE = \.95.bE\ = 1.4, and  bn = 2.2. The equations with these parameters are implemented in MatLab script  WCcortexSTM.m. This program permits you to specify the width of a stimulus pulse  which is then presented to the network at an intensity 5 = 1.0 for just 10 ms. Using a  lOOum-wide stimulus, for example, produces the final activity state plotted in the top  panel of Fig. 7.11. Although the stimulus was only on for 10 ms. the network switches to  an asymptotically stable steady state that is approximately the same width as the stimulus.  Rerunning the program with a 1000-z.im-wide stimulus triggers the network into the final  state shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 7.11. Following brief stimulation, therefore, the  network switches into a state that retains information about stimulus location and width  encoded as a self-sustaining neural activity pattern. This represents a more realistic  generalization of the prefrontal short-term neural memory discussed in the previous  chapter, and it foreshadows aspects of hippocampal memory networks to be discussed  in Chapter 14.  Although parameters have been chosen to satisfy (7.25) so that no spatially uniform  steady states can exist, the simulations clearly demonstrate that spatially inhomogeneous  states with asymptotic stability do exist. The qualitative reason for this is that short-range  recurrent excitation can stabilize a narrow pulse of neural activity while the longer range  inhibition prevents the excitatory activity from spreading.
