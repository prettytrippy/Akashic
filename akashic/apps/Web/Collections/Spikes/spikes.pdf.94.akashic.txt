Keizer (1983) developed a simple model for the action potentials produced by 0 cells in the  pancreas by adding a slow hyperpolarizing potential to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations.  Although their parameters were adapted to the pancreas, a neural version of their model  can be produced by including a hyperpolarizing potential in our Hodgkin-Huxley model:  dF  0.8 — = -(17.81 +47.71F+32.63F2)(F-0.55)  d?  v  '  - 26.0R( V + 0.92) - 0.54/7( V + 0.92) + /  dR  1  d?  1.9V  d//_ 1  ~d7~250'  /?+1.35 F+1.03)  (10.2)  H +  93(V+0.70))  This is just eqn (9.7) with the addition of an //-mediated hyperpolarizing current having a  reversal potential equal to that of K+ (—0.92 or — 92 mV). Because V = -0.70 when/= 0  in the resting state, (10.2) has been designed so that H = 0 as well. The H variable is very  slow here with a time constant of 250 ms. To see the effects of this slow /AHP current on a  Hodgkin-Huxley-type neuron, you can run the MatLab script HHburster.m with  /= 0.14. The resulting spike train is shown in Fig. 10.3A: following a prolonged initial  burst of spikes, (10.2) fires bursts of six spikes each about once every 200 ms. As shown in  the expanded plot of a single burst (Fig. 10.3B), each burst is preceded and followed by a  rapid subthreshold membrane potential oscillation, and the spikes within each burst  occur at a constant spike rate of roughly 175 Hz. Some other very interesting bursting  patterns occur within the range 0.12 < I < 0.25, both very regular patterns like Fig. 10.3  and with some surprisingly irregular ones which, as we shall see in the next chapter, can be  chaotic.  The astute reader may already have guessed the dynamical basis of the bursting pro- duced by (10.2). Recall first that eqn (9.7), from which (10.2) was derived, exhibits hys- teresis because there is a range of inputs /over which a spike-generating limit cycle coexists  160  Spikes, decisions, and actions  -100 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  Time(ms)  40 •  20  0  -20  -40  -60  -80  -100  1 = 0.14  ^x/x/V/v/VV ) j j |J  B  AAAAA/vv-v  10  20  30  40  Time(ms)  50  60  70  80  Fig. 10.3 Bursting produced by hysteresis in (10.2). The time scale in B is expanded to show details of the  burst in A above the bracket at 500 ms.  with an asymptotically stable resting state. This is shown in the bifurcation diagram in  Fig. 9.6. The effect of the very slow //equation in (10.2) is to sweep the effective stimu- lating current /back through the hysteresis region determined by the Fand R equations.  Thus, upon initial suprathreshold stimulation, spikes are generated by a limit cycle at a  fairly high rate. The depolarizations produced by these spikes, in turn, cause a slow  increase in the //-mediated hyperpolarizing current, which effectively reduces the net  stimulus current until firing ceases. As the neuron is then in a resting state, //will slowly  decay to near zero, thus removing the hyperpolarization. At some point, the hyper- polarizing current will be low enough so that the stimulus current will again initiate firing.  This is manifested in a series of bursts separated by periods when the neuron is hyper- polarized below its threshold.  These periods between successive bursts vary enormously with /. For / = 0.1, bursts of  four spikes occur at about 1.3 s intervals. For /sufficiently large, however, all bursting
