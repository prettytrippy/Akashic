tractability, the first equation can be restricted to a cubic in V (based on isocline shapes  discussed above), so g^&(V) must be restricted to a quadratic polynomial. Similarly,  G( V) can only be quadratic if the term R( V - £K) in the first equation is to remain no  higher than cubic. Given these constraints, let us examine the isoclines of (9.4), which are:  R=-g^(V)(V-E^+I  f o r  dV=Q  (9.5)  - £ N ; , ( F ) ( F - £ N a ) ± /  (V-EK)  dR  G(V)  for — = 0  d?  for  dV  ~dl  Setting / = 0 for the moment, it is evident from the first isocline equation that:  R — 0  when  V = £Na  R = oo when  V = £^  These points are marked on the right-hand phase plane in Fig. 9.2. Fhus, simply writing  the dynamics in a form obeying Ohm's law leads to a dV/dt = 0 isocline with a natural  biophysical interpretation in terms of £N3 and £«!  A fit of (9.5) to the isoclines on the left of Fig. 9.2 leads to the following differential  equations:  dV  C — = -(17.81 ± 47.71 V+ 32.63V2)(V- 0.55) - 26.0R(V + 0.92) ± /  dR  1  (9'7)  = -(-R+ 135V+ 1.03)  d?  T  where the capacitance C = 0.8pF/cnr and TR = 1.9 ms. In generating these equations,  the voltages were divided by 100 to keep the parameter values near unity. Thus, the  equilibrium potentials are £N.I = 0.55 (or + 55 mV), and £^ = —0.92 (or —92 mV), which  are the same values that were used in (9.3). Thus. (9.7) expresses potential in deci-volts,  and the input current / is in uA/100. For all comparisons with Hodgkin-Huxley results  the solutions of (9.7) will therefore be multiplied by 100.  Having derived these equations, let us first determine whether they produce spikes that  are accurate reflections of the Hodgkin-Huxley solutions. Figure 9.3 compares spike  shapes at two different spike frequencies and also plots spike rates for both (9.7) and the  full Hodgkin-Huxley formulation over the entire physiological range of input currents/.  Equation (9.7) produces a good approximation to action potential shape, the correlation  between the two spike shapes being > 0.96, and it also reproduces the reduction in spike  amplitude with increasing spike rate observed in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The  reader can explore the dependence of spike rate and spike height on input current /by  running MatLab script HHWeqn.m and varying input current over the range 0 < / < 2.0.  Note that the numerical values of /are also 100 times smaller than those for the Hodgkin- Huxley equations, so the threshold value is in the range 0.0 < / < 0.090. Figure 9.2 also  shows that the dV/dt isocline in (9.5) deforms primarily on the lower left side as /is  Action potentials and limit cycles  141  60  40  20  -  0  i,- 2 0  • - 4 0  - 60  - 8 0  4 0  2 0  «  0  ; - 2 0  - 4 0  - 6 0  - 8 0  •100  (  5 0 0  200 Hz  350 Hz  2  4  6  8  Time (msec)  1 o  ~\  •  r  100  150  200  Current  Fig. 9.3 Comparison of spike trains generated by (9.7) and the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (9.2).
