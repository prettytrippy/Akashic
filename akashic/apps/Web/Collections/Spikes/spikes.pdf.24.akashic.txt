equilibrium length at which the force drops to zero.  breaking of actin-myosin bonds following contraction, and this friction is proportional to  the velocity of contraction. Using Newton's second law (3.1) to describe muscle con- traction leads to the equation:  d x  „ dx  —r + 2a—- + aA  dt2  dt  (X - Ac) = 0  (3.29)  It is easy to see that the equilibrium state occurs when x = An, so we can eliminate XQ by  defining the new variable x' = x — XQ. The coefficients in (3.29) have been carefully  chosen so that the resulting characteristic equation, obtained by substituting x' = tXl,  will have identical eigenvalues:  A2 + 2aX + a2 = 0  (3.30)  so A = —a. This is the most general formulation of the one case not covered by  Theorem 2. One solution will certainly be:  At)  at  (3.31  where a is determined by the initial condition. However, there must also be a second  solution, just as there are always two exponentials when the eigenvalues differ.  Whatever form the second solution takes, it must certainly be some other function of ?.  Let us therefore guess that it involves the same exponential as (3.31) and try to find a  second solution of the form:  x'(r) = A(0e- (3.32)  42  Spikes, decisions, and actions  where /;(?) must be determined. Substituting (3.32) into (3.29) (with the x0 term removed  by the change of variables described above) and differentiating gives:  e-°' ^  - 2a t-'" - + a2 t~a' h + 2a (X Q' ~ - a e"Q' h) + a2 t~al h = 0  (3.33)  d?2  d?  \  dt  J  You can see that almost all the terms cancel conveniently, so (3.33) reduces to:  e— ^  = 0  (3.34)  d?- This is easily solved by integration with the result:  h = bt  (3.35)  where b is an arbitrary constant of integration. Substitution of this result into (3.32)  shows that the general solution to (3.29) is:  .v(?) =at-°'  + btt-a! + x0  (3.36)  where a and b are determined by the initial conditions. This special case, omitted from  Theorem 2, is called critical damping, because the smallest independent variation in the  coefficient of A in (3.30) produces either two different negative real eigenvalues or else a  complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues with negative real parts. Suppose, that is, that the  characteristic equation for a dynamical system was:  A2 + (2a + 6)X + a2 = 0  (3.37)  where 6 represents a small parameter variation. The eigenvalues will produce a spiral  point for small 6 < 0; a node for 6 > 0, and critical damping only when 6 = 0.  Thus, critical damping forms the boundary between an asymptotically stable node  and an asymptotically stable spiral point.  Because of variability in nature, real physiological systems will almost never exhibit  critical damping (for aficionados, critical damping forms a set of measure zero in  dynamics). However, values of coefficients that are close to those producing critical  damping in (3.29) will produce responses very similar to the critical damping condition.  Furthermore, critical damping produces the fastest approach to equilibrium for a linear  differential equation because the two identical eigenvalues are smallest in this case, thus  making the exponential decay fastest. Regarding muscles as an instance of critical  damping, this suggests that evolution has optimized motor control for speed of response.  Returning now to our example of muscle contraction, let us solve (3.29) for one of the  simplest motor control systems in mammals: the control of rapid or saccadic eye move- ments. The open and solid symbols in Fig. 3.5 respectively plot angular positions of  the eye during 15° and 30° saccades (Clark and Stark, 1974). These eye movements  are obviously quite rapid, being completed within about 50 ms of their initiation.  Two-dimensional systems  43  E  E  36  35  34  33  32  3 1  30  29  28
