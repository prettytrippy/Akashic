Fig. 2.8 Piecewise linear solution of (2.18) for an EPSP in which the conductance changes abruptly at 1.0ms.  The shape is very similar to the —81 mV record in Fig. 2.6.  for the first millisecond in Fig. 2.8. (The line appears almost straight only because 1.0 ms is  such a short time relative to the time constant of 12.5 ms.)  After 1.0 ms, we assume that the effects of the neurotransmitter are terminated, so  ge = 0 again (synaptic conductance changes do not end quite so abruptly, but this is still  a reasonable approximation). To solve for the decay in the postsynaptic potential,  therefore, we must now solve the equation:  dV  ~dt'  V(\):  12.5  -64.3  T + 7 5 }  f o r ? > l  (2.21)  Note that our new initial condition is V(\) = -64.3mV, which is not the equilibrium  value. Note also that this initial condition occurs at ? = 1 ms, because that is the time at  which the synaptic conductance reverts to its original value. To shift the initial condition  from 0 to 1 ms, it is only necessary to replace ? by (? - 1) in the solution, so Theorem 1  produces the result:  V(t)  -64.3 e -0.08(7- 75(  -0.08(;-l)\ _  ) = 10.7e -0.08(r-l)  75  (2.22)  for ? > 1 ms. This function is also plotted in Fig. 2.8 beginning at ? = 1 ms. There is a  striking similarity between our mathematical EPSP and the shape of the EPSP obtained in  the —81 mV resting condition shown in Fig. 2.6. Note that the decay back to equilibrium  in (2.22) is three times slower than the initial rise of the potential in (2.20). This is a  mathematical consequence of membrane conductance changes during synaptic trans- mission, and it indicates that this problem is actually nonlinear! We have solved for the  EPSP in this case using what is called a piecewise linear approximation, which is the  simplest approximation to an inherently nonlinear dynamical problem.  Let us see just how nonlinear synaptic interactions typically are. Suppose that the  dendrite is at the -75 mV resting potential, and synaptic activation causes a change from  26  Spikes, decisions, and actions  gl = 0 to g, = 12 nS for 1.0 ms. Referring back to eqn (2.18), you will see that this will  produce no change in membrane potential, because -75 mV is both the resting potential  and the equilibrium potential for the GABAa synapse. Can an inhibitory synapse that has  no effect by itself reduce the excitation produced by an EPSP? To answer this question, let  us assume that an EPSP and an IPSP occur simultaneously in the dendrite. Now we must  solve (2.18) withge = 2nSandg, = 12nS for 0 < ? < 1:  ^ = - T ^ { ( f / + 7 5 ) + 2L+12(L+75)}= - 7T^ ( 1 5 F + 9 7 5 i  (2-23)  The solution is again found using Theorem 1:  V(t) = -10e~12' - 6 5  (2.24)  Now the peak depolarization at ? = 1 ms due to the EPSP has dropped to V = -68 mV.  This is a drop from the peak of -64.3 mV when the EPSP occurred without a concurrent  IPSP. Thus, an IPSP that has no effect on the membrane potential when it occurs alone  has reduced the effect of a concurrent EPSP by about 35%. As a result of this effect,  GABAa synapses are frequently termed shunting synapses because their effect is to shunt  or short circuit the depolarizing current produced by EPSPs. This highly nonlinear  interaction is essentially divisive rather than subtractive, although neural modelers  sometimes assume that inhibition is inherently subtractive. Only when synapses are fairly  far apart on the dendritic tree or on different dendritic branches do EPSPs and IPSPs  interact in a manner approximating addition and subtraction.  2.5  Exercises
