the point at which S(P) reaches half of its maximum. Hence, o is termed the semi- saturation constant. Finally, N determines the maximum slope of the function, or how  sharp the transition is between threshold and saturation. These points will become evident  by inspection of Fig. 2.4, where M = 100, a = 50, and N assumes several values within the  range reported for visual neurons. In particular, Sclar et al. (1990) reported that lateral  geniculate neurons were best fit by values of N averaging 1.4, visual cortical neurons  had lvalues around 2.4, and middle temporal cortex neurons had lvalues around 3.0.  20  Spikes, decisions, and actions  1 00  _  80  o  a>  </>  1 60  Q.  £.  4 0  Q_  OT 2 0  0  r  - - - - ,  i ' i i i  •  /l  •' / '  I .

The bottom panel shows spike rates of four different neurons along with fits of (2.11) to the response rate of  each (reproduced with permission, Albrecht and Hamilton. 1982).  Similarly, Albrecht and Hamilton (1982) reported average values of N = 3.4 and  M = 120. Representative data from the Albrecht and Hamilton (1982) study are plotted  in Fig. 2.4 for comparison. In this book, we shall usually let M = 100 and N = 2  for mathematical convenience. This means that our Naka Rushton function will have  an accelerating nonlinearity near x = 0 and will have a maximum response rate of  100 spike/s. However, none of our conclusions depend on these particular choices. The  semi-saturation constant o will be varied to suit particular mathematical or physiological  contexts. It is important to be aware that (2.11) represents the asymptotic or steady state  firing rate of a neuron. As we shall see, neural responses will generally vary over time as  they approach the rate determined by (2.11). Note that the general form of S{ P) involves a  threshold for P near zero followed by a roughly linear region in which S(P) increases  proportionally to P. Finally, the spike rate saturates for large P. Many mathematically  similar functions have been used in describing neurons, particularly the hyperbolic tan- gent, tanh. However, all of these functions have the same general sigmoidal, or S-like  First order linear systems  21  shape, which is exhibited by S(P) in Fig. 2.4. As the Naka-Rushton function in  (2.11) provides the best fit to physiological data (Albrecht and Hamilton, 1982), it will be  used here.  We can now write down a differential equation describing the response of a single  neuron to an arbitrary stimulus. If the Naka-Rushton function with M = \00,N = 2,and  a = 40 is designated by S(P) and the neural response or spike rate is designated by R, then:  dR  "d7  -R + S(P))  (2.12)  Let us solve this equation as a function of ? on the assumption that R(0) = 0. From  Theorem 1, the solution may be seen to be:  R(t) = Ac •l/r + -  I C  T./O  -('-'')/ TS(P{t'))dt'  (2.13)  This equation describes the responses of cortical cells to a wide variety of time-varying  stimuli. We can obtain exact results for the special case where P is a constant input. Then  eqn (2.13) may be solved by simple integration yielding:  R(t)  -,/T )S(P)  (2.14)
