In this example, as in any linear system, there will be a unique steady state, as sets of  simultaneous linear equations have (except in pathological cases) a unique solution.  Because of this fact, (3.11) can be rewritten by translating the steady state to the origin.  This is simply done by subtracting the coordinates of the steady state solution from x and  v, with the result:  dr  -*,  d?  X' = X-Xeq  so  -r- = AX'  (3.14)  This transformation eliminates the vector B from the equation without otherwise  affecting the dynamics. Once (3.14) has been solved for A", Xtq is simply added to pro- duce the final solution.  We can now derive the general solution to (3.14). As in the simple case of (3.1) above,  where we obtained the characteristic equation (3.3) by substituting an exponential  function for x, we can solve (3.14) by substituting a vector of exponentials for Afwith  arbitrary coefficients a and b:  l'f'\,  so  ^ - = XX' = AX'  (3.15)  htx>)  d?  The right-hand equality here may be rearranged to give:  {A-X1}X'=Q,  where  ' = ( £  J )  (3,6)  / is known as the identity matrix. One trivial solution of this equation is X' = 0, which is  clearly of no scientific interest. This, however, is the unique solution to the equation if  the matrix {A — XI} has an inverse (the reader should convince herself of this by applying  the inverse of this matrix to both sides of the equation). Therefore, (3.16) can have non- trivial solutions only if {A — XI} does not have an inverse. As is derived in linear algebra  texts, this can occur only if the determinant of this matrix vanishes:  \A-XI\  = 0  (3.17)  The determinant in (3.17) is just a quadratic polynomial, so (3.17) generates the  characteristic equation for the system (3.14). To continue our earlier example, if we take  A from (3.13), eqn (3.17) yields:  A-XI  -9 - A  - 5  1  - 3 - A  ( - 9 - A ) ( - 3 - A ) + 5 = 0  (3.18)  The solutions to this quadratic equation are A = -4, - 8. These solutions of the char- acteristic equation are called eigenvalues. We have thus derived a theorem applicable to all  Two-dimensional systems  33  cases where the two eigenvalues are not identical (that unusual case is treated later):  Theorem 2: The solution to the second order differential equation:  dX  « -  - — = A X + B  dt  is obtained by first solving for the equilibrium state:  A; eq  -A  B  Next, one determines the two eigenvalues, A| and A2, of the characteristic  equation:  |2-A/| = O  where /is the identity matrix. Assuming A] 7^ A2, the solution is:  -(:;:::)+(::«)+*<  where a\, a2, b\, and b2 are constants determined by substitution back into the  original equation and by the initial conditions.  The task of solving for the coefficients a\, a2, b\, and b2 is really quite mechanical and  we will therefore let MatLab™ do the work for us. However, it is important to have an  understanding of the operations involved. We will need four equations to solve for the  four unknown parameters. To obtain the first two equations, we substitute AT back into  the original differential equation, which produces two algebraic equations in a\, a2, b\,  and b2. This procedure is known as obtaining the eigenvectors of the A matrix. Two  further equations are required to solve for the remaining two coefficients, and these  equations are supplied by the initial conditions.  Let us see how this works out in practice by considering an example. We have seen from  (3.15) that substitution of a vector of exponential functions into a second order differ- ential equation in normal form reduces it to a matrix equation of the form:  XX=AX  In this equation A is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. From the example in (3.18) we have  found that A = - 8 is one of the eigenvalues of the matrix:  (3.19)  34
