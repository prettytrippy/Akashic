Fhe solutions to eqn (12.9) above were based on the assumption that UJ\ = UJ2 = u>. As a  second important example, suppose that the frequencies are not identical but the coupling  190  Spikes, decisions, and actions  strengths are, so a\ = a2 = a. The solution of (12.9) is now:  0 = arcsinl - la cos CT  if  UJ2 — u>\  2acos(a) < 1  and the phase-locked frequency in (12.2) will be:  d0.  d? = UJI + c/sin(0 + a)  (12.15)  12.16)  The inequality in (12.15) arises from the fact that the sine function is bounded by ± 1. This  means that a phase-locked solution to (12.9) is only possible if the frequency difference  between the uncoupled oscillators is sufficiently small relative to the sum of the coupling  coefficients multiplied by cos(cr). When this is not satisfied, the two oscillators will drift in  relative phase, as we shall see shortly. Assuming that the inequality is satisfied, (12.15) will  have two solutions differing in phase, but only one will be asymptotically stable. If  u)\ = ui2 the oscillators will be synchronized if a > 0. On the other hand, if the connections  between oscillators are inhibitory, then the coupling coefficient a < 0. Now when u>\ = ui2  the asymptotically stable phase solution will be 0 = n assuming that o < TT/2 (see eqn  12.10). Thus, inhibitory coupling leads to phase locking in antiphase rather than syn- chronization in this case.  Before considering several neural examples, let's note the most general solution to  (12.10), which is:  arcstn  (UJ2  V A  + 0  where  i = \l(a2 + ai) (costr) + (a2 - ai) (sintr)  (a2 - a\) sincr^  [12.17)  0 = arctan  a2 + a\ )coso  This equation will again have two phase-locked solutions, one unstable and one  asymptotically stable, if \UJ2 - UJI\/A < 1. It can be shown that (12.11) and (12.15) are  special cases of (12.17).  12.2 Pairs of synaptically coupled neurons  This discussion of oscillator interactions has employed the very general phase oscillator  approach, and the choice of the coupling function 77(0) in (12.6) may seem too simple to  provide physiologically relevant insights. To see just how well the phase oscillator model  actually works, let us consider the simplest possible physiological example: two neurons  reciprocally coupled by either excitatory or inhibitory synapses.  To examine the effects of synaptic interactions, it will be convenient to begin with a  neuron incorporating a simulated /A current described by eqn (9.10). As this neuron can  fire spikes at arbitrarily low rates, this will enable us to explore the effects of spike rate on  Synapses and synchrony  191  synaptic interactions most easily. Synaptic inputs can be added to this equation using the  formulation from Chapter 2. If the time constant of the synaptic potential is rsyn and its  equilibrium potential £syn, synaptic inputs to (9.10) produce the equation:  dV  — = -{l7.81+47.58F+33.8F 2}(F-0.48)-26/?(F+0.95) + /  -kg(V-Em)  dR  1  d?  5.6V *+l-29K+0.79 + 3.3(F + 0.38ry  qY=J_  d?  rsyn  _? = _L  dt  Tsvn  where  {-f+Hsttp(vpn-n))  i-g+f)  -r^step(-V)  1 if X > 0  0 if .v < 0  The synaptic potential is generated by variation of the synaptic conductance variable g  with time constant rsyn. Changes in the conductance g are driven by the variable/, which is  in turn driven by the voltage of the presynaptic neuron, Vpre, using the step function  /7step(.x). 7/step(-x) = 1 whenever Fpre > fi, the threshold for postsynaptic conductance
