they are the first and most famous equations that have been shown to have chaotic  dynamics. Let us now turn to an example from neurobiology: the Hodgkin-Huxley  equations as simplified in (9.7). The only difference is that a sinusoidal component has  been added to the stimulus current /, producing the system:  0.8-^-= -(17.81 + 47.71 F+32.63 F2)(F-0.55) - 26.0R(V+0.92) + I  ^  = - 1 o(-«+l.35F+1.03)  (»"6)  d?  1.9  / = /,, + Asm(2mot)  We have already seen that this equation only produces periodic spike trains generated by  limit cycle dynamics when / is a constant in the suprathreshold range. Is there any  combination of /0, A, and u> that will produce chaos? One's first intuition might be 'of  course not', because chaos cannot occur in a system with fewer than three dimensions,  and (11.6) contains only two differential equations. This is incorrect, however, for (11.6) is  Neural chaos  1X1  /Vul/wl/VlwW  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100  Time(ms)  Fig. 11.4  Spikes generated by (11.6) for A = 0 . 1 . This represents a more complex limit cycle in which every  third spike is missing.  in fact equivalent to a four-dimensional system, as the sine term is the solution of two  additional linear, first order differential equations. Thus, (11.6) has sufficiently high  dimensionality to permit chaos to occur.  To explore the range of possible solutions, let us set /o = 0.075 and w = 264.6 Hz and  determine how the solutions vary with amplitude A. If you run the script HHWchaos.m  with A = 0, you will see that a spike train is generated with a frequency of about 170 Hz.  Running the program again with A = 0.4 will produce a spike train at 264.6 Hz as a result  of locking to the sinusoidal stimulus. Between these two extremes, the patterns get much  more interesting. An amplitude A = 0.1 generates the spike train plotted in Fig. 11.4. The  spike train is still periodic, but the period now involves two spikes followed by a sub- threshold response. It can be verified that this is simply a more complex limit cycle  oscillation by running the tests for chaos. For A =0.1 you will find that the power  spectrum is very complex and would be almost impossible to distinguish from chaos. This  is because the limit cycle waveform is so highly nonlinear that there are a large number  of higher harmonic frequencies present. However, the first return map with a criterion of  F=0.0 has only two points (with a tiny scatter due to simulation errors), thus demon- strating that this is a limit cycle. Finally, the Lyapunov exponent, which can be deter- mined using LyapunovHHW.m, is found to be A = -0.16. This verifies that the spike  train in Fig. 11.4 is an asymptotically stable limit cycle rather than chaos. Chaos in  dynamical systems is frequently approached through a series of bifurcations as some  parameter varies. In the most common case, the period doubles, then doubles again, etc.  For the Hodgkin-Huxley model, however, the bifurcations are rather more complex than  period doubling, but the principle of approaching chaos through a series of bifurcations  still holds. Reducing the value of A in these simulations by a small amount will reveal  several more such bifurcations (e.g. at A =0.04).  Let us now repeat the simulation with A = 0.007. This produces the erratic spike train  depicted at the bottom of Fig. 11.5. This certainly appears to be chaotic, but the three  chaos tests must be applied to be certain. A slightly different strategy can be adopted to  generate the first return map in this case, because the stimulus frequency, 264.6 Hz,  defines a natural period at which to sample the system.
