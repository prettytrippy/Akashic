ionic currents, excitatory and inhibitory network connectivity, and neuromodulation  produces the swimming rhythm of lamprey central pattern generators.  13.2 Traveling waves and swimming  Command signals to central pattern generators in individual lamprey segments are suf- ficient to evoke oscillatory responses with alternate left and right activity, but this alone  cannot produce swimming. The oscillations in successive segments must also be coordi- nated so that waves of contraction ripple along the body producing smooth forward  movement as shown by the MatLab animation swimmingLamprey.m. Experiments using  the isolated lamprey spinal cord have shown that waves of neural activity travel along the  cord even in the absence of muscles or sensory feedback (Cohen et ai, 1982). Thus, the  neural architecture within the spinal cord must be capable of generating traveling waves  by itself.  As the lamprey spinal cord contains approximately 100 segments, modeling the entire  array with 800 differential equations based on (13.1) would be formidable. Fortunately,  the phase oscillator model of Cohen et al. (1982) can be used to predict conditions under  which neural connections between segments will lead to the traveling waves of neural  activity observed experimentally. Let us therefore consider chains of coupled phase  212  Spikes, decisions, and actions  oscillators as depicted in Fig. 13.1 A. Each of the N oscillators (only seven are depicted) is  coupled to its neighbors in the adjacent segments. This represents a simplification, because  intersegmental coupling extends beyond nearest neighbors in the lamprey spinal cord  (Grillner et ai, 1995; Grillner, 1996; Cohen et ai, 1992). Nevertheless, nearest neighbor  coupling can elucidate the principles underlying traveling wave generation during lamprey  swimming. Swimming is produced by a wave of segmental oscillator activity traveling  from the rostral (head) to the caudal (tail) of the animal in forward swimming or in the  reverse direction for backward swimming. Furthermore, experiments have shown that  there is always approximately one wavelength of neural activity per body length of the  animal independent of swimming speed (Grillner et ai, 1995; Cohen et ai, 1992). These  observations will be explained by studying a chain of coupled phase oscillators.  A traveling wave in a chain of coupled neural oscillators is defined as a phase-locked  solution in which there is a constant phase difference |0| < 7r/2 between adjacent seg- ments. In the lamprey with 100 segments per body length or wavelength, therefore,  |0| w 7r/50. The intersegmental phase differences are defined as 0, = 9I+] - 8,. This  means that a traveling wave solution with 0, < 0 corresponds to a wave traveling from  head to tail of the animal, while 0, > 0 corresponds to a wave traveling from the tail back  to the head.  The N equations for a lamprey spinal network with nearest neighbor coupling repre- sent a natural generalization of (12.2), and equations analogous to (12.3) are derived by  setting 0, = 9i+] - 9, for; = 1 to N - 1 (see Fig. 13.1 A). Fhe sinusoidal form for coupling  functions in (12.6) will again be used. Assuming that all descending coupling (rostral to  caudal) is identical, and all ascending coupling (caudal to rostral) is also identical, only  two coupling coefficients «d and aa a are required along with a synaptic delay o. Thus, the  equations for the N coupled phase oscillators are:  d0]  . ,n  A  -—— = uj] + a, sin((+ -8] + o)  dt  68  - - = w,+flasin(c?/+i -8, + a) + adsm(9,_] - 9, + o)  i = 2  N-\  (13.4)  d?
