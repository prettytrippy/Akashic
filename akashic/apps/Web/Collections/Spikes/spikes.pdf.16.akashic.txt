1. Solve the following equation for the initial condition x(0) = 17.  d.v  1  d7 = T 3 ( ^ + 5 )  2. Solve the following equation for the response rate R(t) of a neuron for each of the  following values of the postsynaptic potential: P- 10, 20, and 30. Plot your results on a  single graph for times up to 100 ms assuming that R(0) = 5 in each case.  dR  1 /  50P4  R +  dt  20 V  154 + />4  3. Prove that eqn (2.9) follows from (2.6) and (2.8) by solving using Theorem 1. Now add  a fourth stage, call it w(t) to (2.7) governed by the equation:  dlV  1  Derive the solution w(t) for vt'(0) = 0. Does this agree with eqn (2.10)?  First order linear systems  27  4. In this problem we will explore a piecewise linear approximation to action potential  generation. There are two ionic channels, one for Na"1" (£Na = 50mV) and one for K+  (£K = -90 mV), resulting in the equation:  ^ = - 4 { g N a ( K - 5 0 ) + g K ( l / + 9 0 ) }  where gic = 0.6 is the K+ resting conductance and gNa =0.1 is the Na+ resting con- ductance. First solve for the equilibrium or resting potential and use this as the initial  condition for the following. After threshold depolarization, the action potential may be  approximated by three successive stages:  (a) A brief but large Na+ conductance increase, so let gNa = 5.0 and £ K = 0 . 6 for  0< ?< 1 ms.  (b) Na+ conductance decreases to zero and K+ conductance increases, so gNa = 0 and  gk = 2.0 for 1 <?<4ms.  (c) Both conductances return to normal, so gNa = 0.1 and gK = 0.6 for ? < 4 ms. Calculate  the piecewise linear solution to this problem and plot the result. This problem should give  you an intuitive feel for the role of Na+ and K+ conductance changes in generating the  action potential.  5. Generalize eqn (2.19) to the case where there are N simultaneous excitatory synaptic  events. Assuming that there is no inhibition and that ge = 2 nS, the equation becomes:  ^~ = --^-{(V+75)  + 2NV}  f o r 0 < ? < l  d?  12.5  V(0) = -75  Obtain the analytical solution for 0 < ? < 1 ms (you need not solve for the decay phase).  Plot the peak EPSP value V{\) for 1 < N< 12. Do EPSPs add linearly, or does the bio- physics produce saturation effects?  6. Solve eqn (2.18) for the case where there is one excitatory synaptic event but N con- current inhibitory events. Assuming that ge = 2 nS, and g, = 12 nS the equation becomes:  ^-=--±-{(V+75)  + 2V+l2N(V+75)}  dt  lz.5  V(0) = -75  Obtain the analytical solution for 0 < ? < 1 ms (you need not solve for the decay phase).  Plot the peak EPSP value V{\) for 0 < N < 8. Discuss the results of this shunting inhibition  in terms of the linearity or nonlinearity of synaptic effects.  Two-dimensional systems and  state space  The first order differential equations discussed in the previous chapter are limited in their  applicability, as a single equation can only describe responses of a single neuron or a single  postsynaptic potential, etc. We are mainly interested in studying systems in which many  neurons interact to produce complex behavior. This leads us naturally to consider what  happens when several first order differential equations are coupled together to produce a  neural network. As all of the dynamical features of multi-component linear systems can  occur when only two component processes interact, this chapter will focus on an  exhaustive classification of the behavior of such systems.
