Nonlinear neurodynamics and bifurcations  77  6.4 A short-term memory circuit  In the previous example, we analyzed a nonlinear, two-neuron network that had a single  equilibrium point in the first quadrant. However, many nonlinear systems are interesting  precisely because they have multiple equilibria, so let us examine such a system now. To  motivate the mathematical discussion, we shall examine a physiological example invol- ving short-term memory. Consider an experiment in which a monkey is first presented  with a briefly flashed stimulus, a red or green light in this case. The stimulus then dis- appears, but the monkey is required to wait during a delay until it receives a second signal  indicating that it is time to respond. The monkey must then make one of two responses  indicating whether it remembers a red or green stimulus, and it is rewarded if the response  is correct. This is known as a delayed matching task, because the monkey must remember  the stimulus during the delay in order to be rewarded. Fuster (1995) has shown that single  neurons in the temporal and prefrontal cortex of monkeys can be switched on by the brief  stimulus presentation, and these neurons will then continue to fire at a higher rate for 20 s  or more after the stimulus disappears. For example, the neuron shown in Fig. 6.3  increased its firing rate following presentation of a red stimulus and maintained its  increased firing rate for 16 s after the stimulus vanished, when the monkey made a correct  choice and was rewarded. This particular neuron was selective for the red stimulus, as it  never responded to the green one.  Let us examine a very simple neural network with responses like those of prefrontal  neurons during this delayed response task. The system consists of just two neurons which  are mutually excitatory and whose spike rates are described by the Naka-Rushton  function in (2.11) and Fig. 2.3 with a maximum spike rate of 100/s and N = 2. Assuming  that the neurons have identical properties and connection strengths for simplicity, they  will be described by the equations:  dF,  1 /  100(3F  -Ei +  d?  T\  1202 + (3F2)2 ;  (6.:  dF2  1 [  100(3F,)  -E2 + - d?  T \  '  1202 + (3F,  This problem can be tackled in the same fashion as the previous one: first plot the isoclines  and find the equilibrium points, then use Theorem 8 to determine the stability char- acteristics of the equilibria.  The state space and isoclines of (6.8) are plotted in Fig. 6.4. The isoclines intersect at  three points rather than just one, so this system must have three steady states. Solving the  isocline equations for steady states will generally require numerical approximations  using MatLab. However, in this case the symmetry of the problem simplifies things  considerably. From the symmetry of (6.8), it can be inferred that E\ = F2 at equilibrium,  so the steady states will obey the simplified equation:  100(3F,)2  1202 + (3F,)2  78  Spikes, decisions, and actions  a.  1/1  30  25  20  15  10  5  0  15  • RED  | GREEN  Choice  25  30  Seconds  Fig. 6.3 Responses of a neuron in monkey inferiortemporal cortex during a short-term memory task  (reproduced with permission, Fuster, 1995). Following a 1.0 s presentation of a red sample, this neuron fires  at more than twice its resting level for 16 s until the signal to make a match appears and the monkey makes a  choice to receive a reward. The same neuron did not increase its response when the sample was green.  100  90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  10  0  •  y,  y  /  / /  dE2?dt = 0  \  /  S  (20, 20)
