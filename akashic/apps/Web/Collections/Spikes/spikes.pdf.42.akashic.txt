never discussed today except for the zero slope case, so the term isocline will only be used  here in the restrictive sense defined by (6.2).  6.2 A divisive gain control  To fix these ideas, let us consider a nonlinear gain control network that employs feedback  inhibition. This network was originally developed as a cortical divisive gain control to  explain certain aspects of psychophysics related to orientation selective cells in the visual  cortex (Wilson and Humanski, 1993). More recently, a similar feedback circuit has been  used to describe amacrine cell feedback onto bipolar cells in primate and human retinas  (Wilson, 1997; see Chapter 7). The simple negative feedback network to be described here  is like the cone, horizontal cell feedback network discussed in Chapter 3, except that the  inhibition divides the stimulus to the first neuron. As pointed out in Chapter 2, shunting  inhibitory synapses are well approximated by division.  Letting B represent the bipolar cell response to light level L and A the amacrine cell  response, the equations are:  dB  1 /  d? ~ TB V  dA  1  77 " rA  ("  L  B+l+A  -A+2B)  (6.3)  This equation has well-behaved solutions in all regions that exclude A = -\, where the  right-hand side of the first equation becomes infinite and the solution is not defined. As  the light inputs L can only be positive or zero, however, it is easy to show that if the initial  conditions lie in the first quadrant or at the origin, then the system must stay in the first  quadrant for all future times. That is, if ,4(0) > 0,5(0) > 0,andL > 0 solutions can never  leave the first quadrant. To prove this, note that whenever B = 0, dB/dt > 0 because A,  74  Spikes, decisions, and actions  0  8  6  4  2  ['  \  /  /  /  - /  I  .

The unique steady state in the first  quadrant is located where the isoclines intersect.  L > 0. Therefore Bmust become positive (or remain zero), but it cannot become negative.  Similarly, dA/dt > 0 whenever A = 0, so A can never become negative. Thus, all trajec- tories starting in the first quadrant must remain there.  The isoclines are now obtained by setting the derivatives in (6.3) equal to zero,  giving:  L  B  1 + A  and  A  IB  (6.4)  These are plotted in the state space of this system in Fig. 6.1. The one intersection of the  isoclines in the first quadrant defines the steady state, which can be obtained analytically  in this case by solving (6.4):  2B, B  -1 + 71771  (6.5)  Note that the second root or equilibrium point does not lie in the first quadrant, so it is  irrelevant to the neurobiology of the problem. Neural systems with multiple steady states  in the first quadrant will be considered shortly. In the example plotted in Fig. 6.1, L—10,  so the steady state is at: B = 2; A = 4.  6.3 Stability of steady states  Having found the equilibrium point of (6.3), let us now determine its nature (node, spiral  point, etc.) and stability characteristics. For a linear system this simply requires obtaining  the eigenvalues from the characteristic equation, but how should we proceed with a  nonlinear system? The answer turns out to be simple: expand the nonlinear functions in  (6.1) or (6.3) in a Taylor series evaluated at the equilibrium point and retain only the  linear terms. This produces an associated linear equation in the vicinity of the equilibrium  Nonlinear neurodynamics and bifurcations  75  state:  dt Vx2
