Among its many capabilities are making decisions and  carrying out complex motor actions such as swimming. Nonlinear  dynamical modelling can be used to understand and explain neural  phenomena at many different levels, including:  • ion currents and action potentials  • short- and long-term memory  • visual hallucinations  • neural synchronization  • motor control  This book explores the mathematical principles by which brains  generate spikes, make decisions, store memories, and control actions.  It assumes a basic knowledge of calculus and develops the dynamical  foundations of neuroscience using problem sets and computer simula- tions on the accompanying PC and Mac compatible MatLab™ disk.  Spikes, Decisions and Actions is an ideal text for courses in  computational neuroscience, neural modelling, and nonlinear modelling  in biology.  OXFORD  UNIVERSITY PRESS  www.oup.com
