that Rinzel (1978) predicted this hysteresis and the experimental conditions for observing  it. A second equally fascinating consequence of the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 9.6 is the  prediction that a depolarizing pulse at just the right time during a spike train should  permanently extinguish it. This, too, was predicted by Rinzel (1978) and Best (1979) and  experimentally demonstrated by Guttman et al. (1980). The phenomenon is explored in  the Exercises.

The neuron  shows a higher probability of firing at the same phase of each stimulus period.  9.4 Noisy neurons: improving auditory thresholds  All neural systems contain some physiological noise due to fluctuations in ionic con- centrations, etc. Noise is normally regarded as being deleterious to the operation of a  system and as something to be avoided or minimized. This is always true in linear systems,  but there are circumstances in which noise can actually improve the performance of a  nonlinear system. Let us examine one such example that has been explored by Longtin  (1993, 1995).  Consider the data in Fig. 9.7, which were recorded from an auditory nerve fiber in a  squirrel monkey (Rose et al., 1967). This is an interspike interval (ISI) histogram in which  the data refer to the intervals between successive spikes fired by a neuron in response to  sinusoidal stimulation at 412 or 600 Hz. The stimulus period is listed in each plot, and the  dots on the abscissa indicate integral multiples of that period. It is evident from the graph  that the neuron did not fire during each period of the stimulus. Rather, firing was  probabilistic: the first peak in the histogram indicates the frequency with which two spikes  occurred one period apart; the second peak is the frequency with which the neuron missed  one period so that the spikes occurred two periods apart, etc. It is obvious from the  records that this neuron can miss five or more periods between action potentials. Note  also that successive peaks decrease in amplitude approximately exponentially, which  suggests a Poisson process.  How might this erratic neural behavior be explained? More interestingly, could there be  any functional advantage to this noisy behavior? Both questions can be answered by  simulating this experiment on the neuron described by (9.7).

Clustering of responses at integral multiples of the stimulus period is indicative of  stochastic resonance (compare with Fig. 9.7).  current /to this neuron is a sinusoidal function of time with a frequency of 208 Hz. If you  run the MatLab script HHnoise.m without noise (set SDnoise = 0), you will find that the  threshold stimulus amplitude to generate a train of spikes is about 0.041. Reducing the  amplitude to 0.025, about 60% of the threshold value, the equations generate only a weak  subthreshold oscillation in V, and no spikes are produced. Now suppose some physio- logical noise is added to the input current. Let us assume the noise is Gaussian and  has zero mean and standard deviation SDnoise = 0.12. Now the equations generate  approximately 60 spikes/s. Figure 9.8 shows the ISI histogram for eqn (9.7) under these  conditions, and it clearly reflects all of the major characteristics of the auditory neuron in  Fig. 9.7. In particular, successive histogram peaks decrease in size and are centered near  integral multiples of the 4.81 ms stimulus period.  Fhis simulation makes it easy to understand the effects of noise on the neural response:
