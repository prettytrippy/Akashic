The IPSPs simulated here are due to GABAa  channels, which are present on all cortical neurons (Gutnick and Moody, 1995), including  those of human neocortex (McCormick, 1989). The equilibrium potential for our exci- tatory synapse may be obtained from the data in Fig. 2.6, which shows EPSPs generated at  a synapse for different values of the resting membrane potential V (Huettner and  Baughman, 1988). It is apparent that the reversal potential occurs close to OmV, which  is the value we shall adopt. Similarly, the data in Fig. 2.7 show that the early  GABAa equilibrium potential (due to Cl~ ions) is about — 75 mV in human neurons  (McCormick, 1989). The average resting potential for human neurons is also about  -75 mV (Avoli et ai, 1994). If we setgi = 1 nS and r =12.5 ms, (2.17) becomes:  d_K  "d7:  12.5 {(V+75)+geV  +  gl(V+75)}  (2.18)  When there is no transmitter release at either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, ge = 0 and  gi = 0, and it is easy to see that V = -75 mV is the equilibrium value of (2.18).
