Running this script  with a constant spatial stimulus of width 100 urn will produce a spatially localized  oscillation with the F(?) waveform plotted in Fig. 7.14. Each peak of this oscillation  corresponds to a burst of action potentials at a peak rate of about 50 Hz. Even more  complex oscillations can be produced by stimuli of greater widths. For example, a  constant stimulus 400 urn wide produces a spatially adjacent pair of synchronized  100  Time (ms)  150  200  Fig. 7.14 Spatially localized oscillation produced by (7.22) in a different parameter ran ge.

A stimulus 800 um in width produces an even more complex oscillation with a  pair of synchronized flanking regions oscillating out of phase with a narrow central  oscillation. The dynamical basis for both nonlinear oscillations and synchrony between  interacting oscillators will be covered in the next several chapters.  112  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Finally, the Wilson-Cowan (1973) equations can produce traveling waves of neural  activity in response to brief local stimulation in an appropriate parameter range. Suffi- cient conditions are that the parameters be the same as in the oscillatory mode just  described but that the inhibition be severely reduced in effectiveness. This can easily be  accomplished by providing a constant inhibitory input to the I cells. The MatLab script  WCcortexWAVES.m incorporates the same parameters as the oscillatory mode but  incorporates reduced inhibitory effectiveness by setting Q = -90. Running this script will  generate the pair of traveling neural activity waves illustrated in Fig. 7.15 in response to a  5 ms stimulus to the center of the network. These waves originate because the reduced  inhibitory activity is not sufficient to contain the activity generated by recurrent acti- vation. These traveling waves are followed by a refractory area where the inhibition has  built up. Because of this trailing refractory zone, two waves that meet will annihilate one  another. This phenomenon can be observed by triggering waves at two points in the  network simply by changing the commenting (lines beginning with %) as indicated in the  program. Traveling waves such as these may occur in epileptic seizures and other forms of  abnormal neural activity.  Waves of neural activity are also known to be important in retinal development (Feller  et al.. 1996). Before the photoreceptors become active, a network of amacrine cells  interconnected by excitatory synapses begins to generate traveling waves of neural  bursting. These traveling waves are important in the development of normal connection  patterns from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), presumably causing  coordinated synaptic modification in the latter structure. Feller et al. (1997) have
