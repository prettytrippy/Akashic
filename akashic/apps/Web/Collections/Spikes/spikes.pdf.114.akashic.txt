changes. The magnitude of the postsynaptic potential is controlled by the parameter k and  the equilibrium or reversal potential £syn. For these simulations, let us choose the values  Tsyn = 2ms and fi = —0.20 (i.e. — 20mV). For excitatory synapses, Esyn = 0, while at  inhibitory synapses £syn = —0.92 (i.e. -92 mV).  The use of two differential equations to describe the conductance change at a synapse  was introduced by Rail (1967,1989) and is now in common use. From (2.10), it can be seen  that two such equations will produce a response proportional to (?/Ts 2 yn)exp(-?/Tsyn)  when the stimulus is a brief pulse, and this is Rail's alpha function. In Runge-Kutta  simulations, direct computation of the two differential equations for the alpha function is  about twice as fast as direct use of the exponential. Normalized plots of the synaptic  conductance change g(t) for three different values of rsyn are shown in Fig. 12.1. As can be  seen and easily derived, the peak of the alpha function occurs at ? = Tsyn, so fast and slow  synaptic potentials can be created by varying this parameter. Although employing two  differential equations to describe synaptic conductance changes might seem unnecessarily  complex, it has been shown to be crucial to the understanding of certain neural inter- actions (Van Vreeswijk et ai, 1994). The reason is that conductance changes described by  the alpha function will peak after the end of the initiating spike if rsyn is sufficiently long  (see Fig. 12.1), and this is typical physiologically. As spikes have a brief duration of about  1.0 ms, 77step(.v) will produce about a 1.0 ms pulse (gray rectangle in Fig. 12.1) to thed//d?  equation if the threshold for synaptic activation, fi, is set to a value midway along the  rising phase of the spikes. This generates a very smooth alpha function and avoids the  need to store a record of the time at which each incoming spike arrived at the synapse.  Note also that the area under the alpha function is identical for all values of rsyn.  192  Spikes, decisions, and actions  o  c  S  o  c  o  O  Q.

The rectangle  indicates the duration of the inducing spike.  Putting action potential generation and synaptic inputs together in (12.18) creates what  is known as an isopotential neuron. This is a cell in which the membrane potential V  remains identical throughout both the soma and the dendritic tree. More realistic models  with multiple dendritic compartments will be developed in Chapter 15. Nevertheless,  isopotential neurons are in common use in neural modeling (e.g. Wang and Rinzel, 1992;  Skinner et ai, 1994; Rolls and Treves, 1998), and a lot can be learned by studying them.  Let us now explore phase locking between two neurons, each described by eqn (12.18).  The MatLab program EPSPinteractions.m simulates the case where the two are reci- procally coupled by excitatory synapses, with each receiving an independent input /.  Running the program with stimulus levels of 0.4 and 0.3 for the two neurons, and exci- tatory coupling strength k = 0, shows that the two neurons respond at independent fre- quencies uj] = 37 Hz and u>2 = 23 Hz. Rerunning the program with the same two stimuli  but with k = 4 produces phase locking at 45 Hz with the neuron receiving the weaker input
