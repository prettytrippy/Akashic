for long periods of time. As will be seen in a moment, the consequence for the animal is  forgetting. Let us extend our analysis of short-term memory by incorporating neural  adaptation into the network.  The ionic mechanisms underlying neural adaptation will be explored in Chapter 10, but  the reduction of spike rates caused by adaptation can be easily incorporated here. Studies  of both single neurons in visual cortex (Bonds, 1991) and the perceptual consequences of  visual pattern adaptation (Wilson and Humanski, 1993) indicate that adaptation causes a  slow increase in the constant a of the Naka-Rushton function (2.11). This in turn reduces  the firing rate of the neurons. So, in addition to the two neural activity equations in (6.8),  adaptation requires the introduction of two variables, A \ and A2. The resulting system of  four equations is:  dEy = [(_E  |  100(3F2);  d?  T[  '  (\20 + A{)2 + (3E2)2 +  dE2  1 /  r  100(3F,);  -E2 + â€¢  d?  ry  -  (120 + /t2)- + (3F,);y  (6.14)  < ^ = i ( - ^ l + 0 . 7 F 1 )  d?  Ta v  - ^ = I(-^ 2 +0.7F 2)  d?  ra  82  Spikes, decisions, and actions  Assume again that r = 20ms, but because neural adaptation is a very slow process, a  reasonable value for the adaptation time constant is ra = 4000 ms, i.e. 4.0 s! The firing rate  in (6.14) will continuously decrease as A, and A2 increase. Ai and A2, in turn, will increase  when E\ > 0 or F2 > 0 respectively, reaching the equilibrium values:  Ai=0JEi  and  A2=0.7E2  (6.15)  Let us set E\ = E2 due to the symmetry of the network and solve for the equilibrium  states of (6.14), which obey the equation:  120 + 0.7F,)2+9F2) =900F,  (6.16)  F| = 0 is clearly one solution of (6.16), so the resting state (0,0,0,0) is one equilibrium  point of (6.14). After factoring out E\ in (6.16) and solving the resulting quadratic  equation, both roots turn out to be complex. This means that there is only one equilibrium  point for (6.14), and this is at the origin. Does this mean that the system no longer has  interesting behavior and cannot function as a short-term memory network? The answer is  no, and the key to understanding this lies in the fact that the adaptation variables have a  time constant that is 200 times larger than the neural time constants, so At and A2 will  increase very slowly. They change so slowly, in fact, that we can analyze the system using  the approximation that E\ and F2 come to equilibrium very rapidly relative to any change  in A i and A2 so that E\ and F2 are essentially always at the equilibrium determined by the  current values of A\ and A2. Thus, we can understand the behavior of this system by  analyzing the isoclines and equilibrium points of just the first two equations in (6.14)  while treating A i and A2 as parameters. This general approach, in which system behavior  on a fast time-scale is treated as being in equilibrium relative to behavior on a very slow  time-scale, is a widespread and very important method in nonlinear analysis.  Let us set A] = A2 due to symmetry and consider how the isoclines in Fig. 6.4, which  describe system (6.14) when A\ = 0, vary as A\ increases. The isocline equations are now:  100(3F2)2  En  (120 + A\Y + (3F2)  (6.17)  100(3FI)2  (120 + /f,)2 + (3Fl)2  Figure 6.6 shows the isoclines and equilibrium points for A\ = 24 and A\ =36. For  A\ =24, the system still has three steady states, and stability analysis shows that both the  origin and (64,64) are asymptotically stable nodes, while (36,36) is an unstable saddle
