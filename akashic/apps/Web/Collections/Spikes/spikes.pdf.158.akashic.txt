In particular. (15.32) may have multiple equilibrium  Diffusion and dendrites  263  states. If so, there may be a unique trajectory that originates at (i.e. infinitesimally near)  one steady state for z —> -oo and approaches a second steady state as z —» +00. Such a  trajectory connecting two equilibrium points is called a heteroclinic trajectory. Typically,  such a trajectory will exist only for a unique value of the velocity v. Under these conditions  the heteroclinic trajectory defines the shape of a traveling wave for the diffusion reaction  equation (15.28). Let us collect these observations into a theorem and then see how it may  be applied to action potential propagation.  Theorem 17: Consider the diffusion-reaction equation:  where F(V) is nonlinear and transform into the two-dimensional ordinary differ- ential equation in z = x + vt:  dV  d^ = ±i(rvW-F(V))  If this system has more than one equilibrium point, and a heteroclinic orbit joins two  equilibria for some critical value v = vc, then the original equation has traveling  wave solutions that move at velocity vc. Furthermore, this heteroclinic trajectory  defines the shape of the traveling wave.  15.6 Action potential propagation  Theorem 17 seems abstruse in many ways. After all, it is usually impossible to solve  analytically for trajectories in the state space of nonlinear systems. However, it is only  necessary to demonstrate the existence of a heteroclinic orbit for some particular vc; we do  not necessarily have to solve for its shape directly. Moreover, in the case of the Hodgkin- Huxley approximation in (9.7), it is possible to solve for the shape of the traveling wave  front as well as for its velocity. The analysis developed here has been adapted from  FitzHugh's (1969) analysis of spike propagation in the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations.  The diffusion-reaction equations describing the generation and propagation of action  potentials are a simple generalization of (9.7):  0.8 — = D2 — - (17.81 +47.71 F + 32.63V2)(V- 0.55) - 26.0R(V+ 0.92)  dt  dx  (15.33)  — = — (-R + 1.35V+\.03)  dt  \.9y  264  Spikes, decisions, and actions  All that has been added to (9.7) is a term describing the diffusive spread of the membrane  potential Fin the first equation. If (15.33) is transformed to a moving coordinate system  with the substitution z — x+ vt, it is easy to see that the result will be a system of three  coupled first order differential equations. However, previous analysis of (9.7) revealed  that dV/dt > dR/dt during the rising phase of each spike. Accordingly, let us assume  that R remains constant at its equilibrium value during the rising phase of the spike and  focus on the changes in V. Fhis separation of time scales will enable us to study the  propagation of the leading edge of the action potential, although it will not, of course,  allow us to examine the recovery phase, which is driven by R. Accordingly, let us set  R = 0.088, the equilibrium value of R, and transform (15.33) into the moving coordinate  frame z = x + vt.
