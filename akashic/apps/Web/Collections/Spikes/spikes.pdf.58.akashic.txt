mary of fundamental data on light adaptation may be found in Hood (1998)..  Key aspects of retinal anatomy are summarized in Fig. 7.7. Light impinges on the cone  photoreceptors (C) in the retina, and these respond by stimulating both the bipolar cells  (B) and the horizontal cells (H). As we saw in Chapter 3, there is evidence that the hori- zontal cells provide subtractive inhibitory feedback onto the cones and also feedforward  inhibition onto the bipolar cells. The bipolar cells activate both the amacrine cells (A) and  the ganglion cells (G), which provide the retinal output by sending their axons to various  brain centers. Amacrine cells provide negative feedback onto the bipolar cells, and this is  hypothesized to be shunting or divisive in nature (Wilson, 1997). In addition, the ama- crine cells contact interplexiform cells (P), which provide feedback onto the horizontal  cells. Extensive evidence indicates that this amacrine to interplexiform to horizontal cell  feedback circuit is neuromodulatory in nature and uses the neurotransmitter dopamine  (Dowling, 1991; Witkovsky and Schiitte, 1991). The interplexiform feedback circuit  operates very slowly by neural standards, with a time constant on the order of several  seconds rather than tens of milliseconds.  The simplified retinal model in Fig. 7.7 is comprised of six cell types at each spatial  location. In actuality, there are multiple types of bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells, but  100  Spikes, decisions, and actions  restriction to one of each will suffice to explore the dynamical principles involved in  retinal light adaptation. Our model ignores the fact that there are on the order to 106  neurons of each type in the retina, but this is equivalent to restricting visual stimuli to large  uniform fields of light that adapt all parts of the retina equally (see Wilson (1997) for a  model including spatial distributions of each cell type). Let us analyze the six cell circuit in  Fig. 7.7 to examine light adaptation. The circuit equations are:  dB  1 /  6C-5H  B  dt  ,0 V  1+9A,  dA  1 ,  — = —(-A  + B)  d?  80l  dF  1  — =  (-P + 0.1A)  dt  4000  dG  1 (  505  -G  dt  10 V  13 + B  Several aspects of these equations deserve comment. First, the spike rate of the ganglion  cell G is described by a Naka-Rushton function from (2.11) with N= 1. Indeed, this  function was first applied in neurobiology to describe the spike rate of retinal ganglion  cells, and N= 1 was found to give a good fit (Naka and Rushton, 1966). The dC/dt  equation incorporates subtractive feedback from H cells. Note, however, that the  strength of this is modulated by the P cell feedback loop. Thus, the H cell feedback will be  strong at high light levels and weak in dim light. Feedback from A cells is described by a  divisive term in the d5/d? equation. Finally, note that the time constants are 100ms or  faster, with the exception of rp = 4000 ms. This means that the dF'd? equation will change  extremely slowly relative to the other retinal dynamics, which agrees with the physiology  cited above.  To analyze (7.13) we shall, as always, first examine the equilibrium state.
