( = 0 (reproduced with permission, Schnapf et at., 1990). The response at stimulus offset is the mirror image of  that at stimulus onset.  36  Spikes, decisions, and actions  L is the light-induced stimulus due to phototransduction, and k is a constant representing  the strength or gain of the inhibitory feedback from the horizontal cell. (Schnapf et al.  (1990) related their circuit to feedback within the cone itself rather than feedback from  the horizontal cells, but the same equations describe either case.) Appropriate values  for the time constants and the gain are r r = 0.025 S,TH = 0.08 s, and k = 4. Also, we shall  assume C = 0 and H = 0 are the initial conditions. Thus. (3.20) becomes:  — = 4 0 ( - C - 4 / / + £ )  d '  (3.21)  dH  — =  \2.5(-H+C)  d?  In analyzing (3.21) let us first determine the equilibrium state on the assumption that  the light level L is constant. Equating the time derivatives to zero, the equilibrium is  determined by:  ~C-4H+E  = 0  -H+C=0  The solutions to this are easily seen to be:  C = -  and  H = C  (3.22)  Thus, the subtractive feedback in this neural circuit reduces L by the factor 1/5 in the  steady state. If L = 10, the equilibrium state is C = 2, H = 2. Next, we shift the steady  state to the origin by subtracting the equilibrium values from the initial conditions. The  homogeneous equation thus obtained from (3.21) is:  d(C\  f-40  -U0\fC>\  dt\H'J  V12-5  ~ 1 2- 5 J \H'  where C" and H' denote the variables after translation of the steady state to the origin.  We may now use Theorem 2 to find the solution. The initial conditions minus the equi- librium values are C = -2, //' = —2. Running LinearOrder2.m with these initial con- ditions produces the eigenvalues A = -26.25 ± 42.56?. Using Euler's formula (1.15), the  imaginary parts of the eigenvalues may be converted into a real combination of sine and  cosine functions. The MatLab program does this automatically, and produces the  solution:  C{t) = -2e"2625'cos(42.56?) + 8.17e-2625'sin(42.56?)+2  (3.24)  //(?) = -2 e~26 25' cos(42.56?) - 1.23 e^26 25' sin(42.56?) + 2  Two-dimensional systems  37  t>  5  4  £ 3  O  2  1  0  1  1  - -- -—  '•  I  T  ,  1  \  "  ••  V  ,  1 , 1 , 1 . 1 .  • 0 . 2  0.2  0.4  0.6  Time (sec)  0.8  Fig. 3.2 Solution C{t) to (3.21) as represented by (3.24). The response at stimulus onset (t = 0) is very similar  to that of the primate cone in Fig. 3.1.  The equilibrium values (2, 2) have been added in accord with Theorem 2. C(t) is plotted  as a function of time in Fig. 3.2. The similarity between the solution (3.24) and the  physiological data in Fig. 3.1 is apparent. The response at the termination of light  stimulation has not been plotted in Fig. 3.2, but it is mathematically the mirror image of  the response to stimulus onset, and this is evident from the experimental data.  3.4 Stability and state space  Based on Theorem 2, all possible solutions of second order differential equations with  constant coefficients may now be grouped into a small number of categories. This cat- egorization is based on the fact that the characteristic equation is quadratic and therefore  must have exactly two roots. We have already seen that the unique equilibrium point for a  linear differential equation can always be translated to the origin. Thus, it might be
