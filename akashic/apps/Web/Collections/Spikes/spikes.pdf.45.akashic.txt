The other two are found by solving the quadratic equation  that results after factoring E| out of (6.9), which produces the result:  900 ± J (900)" -36(120)- = 50 ± 30  So the remaining two equilibria are at (20, 20) and (80, 80) as shown in Fig. 6.4.  Nonlinear neurodynamics and bifurcations  79  The next task is to apply Theorem 8 to each of the three steady states of (6.8) in turn. To  do this we shall need to know the derivative of the Naka-Rushton function S(x) from  (2.11), where N = 2. From basic calculus:  so  S(x)  dS  M(ax)2  o2 + (ax)  2Mo1a1x  (6.10)  dx  (a2 + (ax)2)2  Letting r = 20 ms, the Jacobian matrix for (6.8) will therefore have the following form:  /  1  20  1  ~20  200(120)29F,  _1_  20  200(120)'9F2  (120)-+(3£i  (120)2+(3F2)  1  ~20  \  (6.11)  /  The Jacobian must be evaluated at each equilibrium point, after which Linear Order2.m  can be used to obtain the eigenvalues. This produces the following matrices and stability  characteristics at the three singular points:  A =  A =  A =  -0.05  0  0  -0.05  -0.05  0.08  0.08  -0.05  -0.05  0.02  0.02  -0.05  , A = —0.05, -0.05  Asymptotically stable node.  ,A =+0.03, -0.13  Unstable saddle point.  (6.12)  , A = —0.07, —0.03 Asymptotically stable node.  Therefore, all trajectories must diverge from (20,20) and trajectories near either (0,0) or  (80, 80) will approach these steady states asymptotically. Try running MatLab script  STMemory.m with a range of different initial conditions to convince yourself that tra- jectories will indeed converge to either (0,0) or (80,80).  6.5 Hysteresis, bifurcation, and memory  This short-term memory network exhibits an important nonlinear phenomenon known  as hysteresis. The term hysteresis is derived from a Greek term meaning 'to lag behind'. In  the present context, this means that the present state of our neural network is determined  not just by the present state of stimulation but also by the history of stimulation. Hys- teresis is most easily exhibited if (6.8) is modified to include an external stimulus K,  so  Spikes, decisions, and actions  assumed to be the same for each of the two neurons. Now (6.9), which defines the steady  states, becomes:  F,  100(3F, +K)'+  I202 + (3F, +A')2  (6.13)  where the subscripted plus sign indicates that the expressions in parentheses evaluate to  zero for negative arguments. The steady state values of E i now depend on K, and MatLab  has been used to solve (6.13) with the results plotted in Fig. 6.5. There is a range of lvalues  between A and B for which three steady states exist. Two are asymptotically stable (solid
