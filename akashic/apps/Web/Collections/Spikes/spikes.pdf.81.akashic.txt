the K+ channel opening and Na" channel closing, which together constitute the recovery  variable (hence the appellation R). The explicit expression for TR(V),  the recovery  time constant, has been included to indicate the general transcendental nature of these  functions.  Using the forms of H(V) and (7(F) derived from the original Hodgkin-Huxley  equations as described above, let us examine the action potentials and the state space of  the system. (Mathematical forms for M( V) and G{ F) are contained in the MatLab scripts  MM.m and GG.m, but they are too complex to provide much analytical insight.) The  script RinzelHH.m implements (9.3), and action potentials are plotted in Fig. 9.1 for  /input = 10 uA. The state space for (9.3) is plotted on the left of Fig. 9.2. Note in particular  that the dR/dt = 0 isocline is straight over most of its range, while the dV/dt isocline is  approximately cubic, although it does not agree with the exact cubic shape assumed in the  FitzHugh-Nagumo equations (8.8). Changes in the spike rate and isocline shapes can be  explored by running RinzelHH.m for different values of the input current. You can also  estimate the threshold current necessary for spike generation: it lies in the range  0 < /input < 10.  50  -100  J II u II  10  Time (ms)  20  Fig. 9.1  Action potentials generated by (9.3), the Rinzel (1985) approximation to the Hodgkin-Huxley  (1952) equations.

Spike height (horizontal double-headed arrows) is primarily determined by the distance between the  equilibrium point on the dRidt isocline (dashed) and the right branch of the dV/dl isocline.  9.2 Essential dynamics of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations  The two-dimensional Rinzel approximation to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in (9.3)  can be simplified still further to reveal the essential dynamical principles underlying action  potential generation. It is evident from the phase plane diagram in Fig. 9.2 (left) that the  dV/dt isocline is roughly cubic in shape, while the dR/dt isocline is linear over most of its  range. These observations were exploited by FitzHugh (1961) in developing the simplified  FitzHugh-Nagumo equations discussed in the previous chapter. In the interests of  mathematical simplicity, however, the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations ignored most  physiological aspects of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, such as adherence to Ohm's law  and explicit reference to the Na+ and K+ equilibrium potentials. Let us develop a more  accurate approximation to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations that rectifies the short- comings of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations while retaining their mathematical tract- ability. To maintain biophysical significance. Ohm's law and the dependence on Na+ and  K+ equilibrium potentials must be made explicit. This approach, which exposes the  biological significance of the isoclines, leads to equations of the form:  d?  dR  ~d7  TR  £Na)  R + G(V))  R(V-EK)+I  (9.4)  These equations have the same form as (9.3), namely an equation for d V/dt that is the sum  of Na+ and K+ currents plus the stimulating current /, and a second equation for the  recovery variable R. (The passive leakage current in (9.3), which plays no role in spike  140  Spikes, decisions, and actions  generation, has been absorbed into the Na+ current for convenience.) For mathematical
