Agmon and Connors,  1989) and D (chattering cell in cat visual cortex. Gray and McCormick. 1996). Each burst in these  mammalian cells is typically comprised of 2-5 spikes.  Equation (10.3) is relatively difficult to analyze (see Rinzel and Lee's (1987) analysis of  the Plant model), but a lot can still be learned by linearizing and using a Hopf bifurcation  analysis as outlined here. Recall first that eqn (9.10), from which (10.3) was derived, has  the three steady states depicted in Fig. 9.9 when / = 0, so spike generation in (9.10) begins  at a saddle-node bifurcation. There is no input current in eqn (10.3), but the A-modulated  current produces a slow depolarization of the membrane which ultimately leads to burst  firing by driving the neuron through a bifurcation. Once bursting begins, the A'-controlled  Cconductance causes a very slow hyperpolarizing current to build up and also inactivates  Neural adaptation and bursting  163  the Acurrent until the burst is terminated. This sequence of events then repeats itself as a  complicated limit cycle in four dimensions.  Running MatLab script PlantBurster.m will produce the bursting pattern shown in  Fig. 10.5A.B. This may be compared with the response of an aplysia (an invertebrate)  R15 neuron, in Fig. 10.4A.B. These neurons can be identified in all aplysias, and the burst  200  400  600  800  1000  1200  1400  1600  Time (ms)  4U  20  0  f - 2 0  -40  -60  - -: _J J]llL<^_  B  - •  - 50  100  150  Time (ms)  200  250  300  200  400  600  800  1000  Time (ms)  1200  1400  1600  Fig. 10.5 Responses of endogenous bursting neuron described by (10.3).

Compare  to Fig. 10.4A.B.  164  Spikes, decisions, and actions  pattern is common across individuals. (Note that model time constants have not been  scaled to fit the very long time-course of the aplysia neuron.) Each burst is followed by  an afterdepolarizing potential (ADP), which has been observed in bursting neurons of  many species (see Fig. 10.4). Mathematically, depolarizing afterpotentials occur  because each spike is followed by a rapid hyperpolarization caused by the R variable  mediated K+ current, yet the slow depolarizing current caused by X has not yet  decayed away fully after the end of the R hyperpolarization. Thus, the ADP is not  produced by a separate ionic current in the model but rather by a combination of fast R  and slower A'currents.  Equation (10.3) describes an endogenous burster, as bursting behavior is triggered  entirely by the slow inward /T current through the cell membrane mediated by X. Such  neurons are particularly important as pacemakers in many invertebrate nervous systems.  The program PlantBurster.m plots an A-C projection of the four-dimensional state space  of (10.3) to show the limit cycle produced by interaction of these two variables. The role of  A'can be analyzed as follows. Solving for the steady states of (10.3) reveals only one in  the physiological range at V = —0.727, X = 0.11, R = 0.25, and C = 0.33, and linear  analysis shows that this is an unstable spiral point. This does not, of course, demonstrate  the existence of a limit cycle, but it does guarantee that the system will not remain at rest.  If, however, the coefficient 7.33 in the dA"/d? equation were replaced by zero, both Xand  C would be identically zero at all steady states of (10.3), so the equations for V and R
