This proves the following theorem concerning constants of motion:  Theorem 15: For any dynamical system of the form (14.19) the function:  rtt  \  ( F ^ A  [G*WA  U{X>y) =  lm*y-JF-(x)dX  is a constant of motion assuming that the integrals can be evaluated. Any  trajectory in the phase plane with initial conditions (A0, yn) will evolve forever  along the locus defined by U(x, y) = U(XQ, yo), a constant.  Thus, when a two-dimensional system such as (14.19) permits solution for a constant of  the motion, we can determine the locus of trajectories in the phase plane exactly even  though the temporal evolution of the system can only be approximated using Runge- Kutta methods.  Fetus now apply Fheorem 15 to the Lotka-Volterra equations (14.18). Fhe first step is  to write the functions on the right-hand side as products:  dR  (  1  — = 2R 1  W  d<  \ 2° '  dW  /  1 >  — = 10IF -1  +^~R  dt  V  5 0°  where the time constants have also been moved over to the right. The two relevant  integrals defined by Theorem 15 are now:  1/20 IF,  1  ,  1  -dIF=—ln(IF  W  \0W  10  200  / ' - l + 1/500/?

This is a conservative nonlinear system.  Fhis function is plotted in Fig. 14.3 for several constant values using the MatLab script  LotkaVolterra.m. It is apparent that all trajectories are stable oscillations about the  equilibrium point (black dot), which is therefore a center. When the wolf population is  low, the rabbits multiply rapidly. This, however, provides more food for the wolves,  whose population now multiplies as they gorge on rabbits. In consequence, the rabbit  population drops, which leads to a decline in the wolf population. The rabbits now begin  to multiply rapidly again, and the cycle repeats itself.  Any oscillation to which Theorem 15 applies is a conservative oscillation, because the  quantity U(x, v) remains constant along the trajectory. Conservative oscillations are not  limit cycles, because there are infinitely many conservative oscillations within any given  neighborhood of each such oscillation. Limit cycles, by definition, are isolated oscillations  with no other oscillatory solutions within some finite neighborhood. Conservative  oscillations in nonlinear systems represent the nonlinear generalization of cosine oscil- lations surrounding a center in linear systems.  There is a simple relationship between conservative oscillations and Lyapunov func- tions. If, as in the Lotka-Volterra example above, all contours <7(.\, y) = A^are closed and  encircle a center, then U(x,y) can always be transformed into a positive definite state  function. First, one subtracts the value of U at the equilibrium point or center. Fhe  resulting function will then be either positive or negative definite in a region surrounding  the center (this region comprises the first quadrant in the Lotka-Volterra example). If the  function is negative definite, multiplication by —1 will convert it into a positive definite  function. Fhis produces a mathematical valley with the steady state as its minimum point.  Unlike a Lyapunov function, however, trajectories do not flow downhill in this case;
