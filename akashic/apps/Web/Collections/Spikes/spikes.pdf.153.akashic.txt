Thus, the flux of a diffusing ion is  identical to the resultant electrical current.  The discussion leading to (15.6) indicated that K = g\irR2, namely, flux is proportional  to dendritic cross-sectional area. Combining this expression with that for D from (15.6)  yields an equation for the dependence of flux on dendritic radius R:  dV  K—=-^2g~g^TTRi'2V  (15.11)  d.v  Thus, the ionic flux or current exiting or entering the end of the parent dendrite is pro- portional to R-/2. Similar considerations may be applied to each of the daughter dendrites  to show that the flux where they join the parent will be proportional to their radii raised to  the 3/2 power. Rail (1962) observed that if the sum of the fluxes entering the daughter  dendrites was equal to the flux exiting the parent, the daughters were mathematically  equivalent to an extension of the parent dendrite. Assuming that the constants g, (internal  conductance) and gm (membrane leakage conductance) are identical for both parent and  daughter dendrites, equality of fluxes across the dendritic junction is guaranteed if the  following equation is satisfied:  R3'2 = rf +rf  (15.12)  Note that rt and r2 need not be identical to satisfy the equation. It should also be men- tioned that all terminal dendritic branches must be the same electrotonic distance from  the soma in order to collapse them into a single cylinder (Rail, 1989). Equation (15.12)  can easily be generalized to equality of fluxes across a dendritic junction with N  256  Spikes, decisions, and actions  2.0  1.8  1.6  1.4  1.2  Q  1.0  w  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  '  •  •  •  •  •  •  • •• •*  0" • •°&,*a  °  »  I  I  I  I  •  . ° °  •  I  1  • Xcell  o Ycell  o  1  1  •  1  0.0  1.0  2 0  3 0  4.0  5.0  Dm0um)  6.0  7.0  90  Fig. 15.3 Dala (reproduced with permission) from Bloomfield et al.

However, anatomical measurements such as those by Bloomfield et al.  (1987) in Fig. 15.3 indicate that (15.13) is a good approximation in many areas of the  brain.  15.3 Separation of variables  The steady state solution of the cable equation (15.5) reveals nothing about the dynamical  properties of important neuronal events, such as postsynaptic potentials. To obtain  dynamical information, (15.5) must be solved directly. In 1807 Joseph Fourier, discoverer  of Fourier analysis, had an insight that resulted in an exact solution to (15.5). This was the
