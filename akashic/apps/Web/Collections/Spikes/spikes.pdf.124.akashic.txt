A depicts network connections within and between left  and right body sides, both of which are controlled by a command neuron (A) and modulated by a serotonin- releasing neuron (S). E neurons have recurrent excitatory connections, while C cells inhibit all neurons on the  other side of the body. Bursting produced by the network equations (13.1) is plotted in B as spike rates, and  individual spikes in each burst are approximated in C.  208  Spikes, decisions, and actions  synapses, thus providing a source of local positive feedback. The role of the C neurons is to  inhibit all of the neurons on the opposite side of the network, so it is these neurons that  produce the alternation of bursting activity via antiphase locking. The L neurons in turn  provide delayed inhibition to the C neurons, and it was originally thought that they played  a crucial role in terminating the inhibition generated by the C neurons. However, recent  neural modeling studies have showed that the L neurons play a small role in the network,  and neural bursting is actually terminated by powerful after-hyperpolarizing (/AHP) cur- rents in both the E and C cells (Hellgren et ai, 1992; Wallen et ai, 1992). Indeed, the most  recent simulation of the lamprey oscillator by Lansner e? al. (1997) eliminates the L neurons  entirely, so L cells will be ignored here as well. In the resulting network excitation will cause  the E neurons on one side of the spinal segment to excite one another, thereby activating  motoneurons and contracting muscles on that side of the body. These E cells simulta- neously stimulate the C neurons, which inhibit all neurons on the other side. Activity on this  one side terminates as a result of spike frequency adaptation resulting from a slow but  powerful /AHP current. This releases neurons on the other side from C cell inhibition; they  become active in response to their brainstem inputs; and the cycle repeats itself. As will be  seen, modulation of the /AHP current by serotonin (5-HT) is responsible for the extended  frequency range of the network (Harris-Warrick and Cohen, 1985: Lansner et ai, 1997).  Simulation of the lamprey spinal oscillator will require just four groups of neurons:  E and C cells for the left and right sides of the body. The simulation can be further simplified  by using just one cell to represent each group. This symmetry subsampling technique was  used when studying the Wilson-Cowan (1972) oscillator, and it is mathematically exact  under conditions where all neurons in a group are identical in their properties and con- nectivity. Indeed, the lamprey oscillator has been simulated with both multiple neurons of  each type (Hellgren etcti, 1992) and with subsampling (Wallen et ai, 1992) with very similar  results. The final decision in modeling this network is the level of description of the indi- vidual neurons. The lamprey oscillator has been simulated with neurons described at the  individual spike and ion current level (Grillner el ai, 1998; Hellgren et ai, 1992; Wallen  el ai, 1992) and at the spike frequency level (Buchanan. 1992; Williams, 1992; Ekeberg,  1993). Following the most recent simulations by Lansner and colleagues (1997), after which  the present simulation is patterned, neuronal responses will be described at the spike rate  level using the Naka-Rushton function (2.11). As discussed in Chapters 6 and 8, the  effects of a slow /AHP adapting current can easily be incorporated when using spike rate  descriptions.
