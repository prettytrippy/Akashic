These equations were obtained from (10.5) by  shortening the time constants and substituting the equilibrium value of X into the FD  equation. Fhis convenient approximation reduces the number of equations for the den- dritic compartment from three to two.  Fhe script Plateau.m implements this two-compartment plateau potential model with  parameter values p = 0.37, gc = 0.1,andgAitp = 1-0. Fhe results of a 75 ms current pulse  to the soma (/ = 1.0 nA) followed 1.5 s later by a hyperpolarizing 75 ms pulse are plotted  in Fig. 15.11. It is apparent that current flowing into the dendrite from the soma is  sufficient to switch on the plateau potential, which then maintains a steady firing rate  (12 spikes/s) until the hyperpolarizing off pulse. The key to this dynamical behavior is  revealed by an examination of the dendritic (l'o,C) phase plane with isoclines from  (15.49) (plotted for V = -0.754, its equilibrium value), which is plotted by Plateau.m.  Fhe parameters in (15.49) guarantee that this plane will have three steady states: two  asymptotically stable and one unstable. You might therefore expect that this neural  model would exhibit hysteresis, and this is so as shown in Fig. 15.12. The dendritic  hysteresis loop at the bottom shows the three steady states between soma currents A and B  (spikes in the soma have been removed by simulated TTX blocking of Na+ channels as in  Chapter 10).  The spike rates generated by the neuron are plotted in the top of Fig. 15.12 under  conditions of sustained current input to the soma. Between points A and B the neuron is  bistable and will maintain firing at either a low or a high rate, depending on the previous  history of stimulation. Fhis bistable firing pattern is also exhibited experimentally by  neurons with plateau potentials (Hounsgaard et ai. 1988; Eken and Kiehn. 1989;  Kiehn, 1991).  The bistability of the dendrite that gives rise to a plateau potential results from the fact  that the /AHP current has been reduced to the point where it can only partially counteract  the inward Ca~+ current. If the conductance is increased to gAPH = 1-5, rerunning  Plateau.m shows that the dendrite no longer has three steady states, and the plateau  potential vanishes. There is evidence that plateau potentials require the presence of  serotonin (Kiehn, 1991), and it was indicated in Chapter 13 that serotonin plays a role in  Diffusion and dendrites  275  200  400  600  800  1000 1200  Time (ms)  1400 1600 1B00 2000  100  0  200  400  600  BOO  1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000  Time (ms)  Fig. 15.11 Simulation of plateau potentials using the two-compartment neuron model in (15.48) and (15.49).

Thus, motorneurons can apparently be para- metrically switched to and from a plateau potential mode via serotonin modulation.  The dynamical explanation of plateau potentials as a result of dendritic hysteresis may  now seem obvious, but one might question whether the use of a two-compartment model  is necessary in this dynamical example. Booth and Rinzel (1995) showed that a two- compartment model was indeed essential by a clever parametric manipulation. When  gc = 0 in (15.48) the soma and dendritic compartments are entirely independent, so
