can be proven by considering the values of both derivatives in (8.2) on the boundaries  of this box: dF/d?>0 when F = 0; dF/d?<0 when F=100; d//d?>0 when /=0; and  d//d? < 0 when /= 100. This represents an enormous simplification when dealing with  nonlinear dynamics of neurons: spike rates are always bounded by zero below and a  maximum value determined by the absolute refractory period. Thus, all trajectories that  enter the box 0 < F< 100, 0 < / < 100, must stay within it, and all trajectories must also  leave some small neighborhood of the unstable equilibrium point. Therefore, we have  created an annulus containing no interior steady states, so by Poincare-Bendixon The- orem 10, an asymptotically stable limit cycle must exist. If you run the MatLab simulation  WCoscillator.m, you will see that an asymptotically stable limit cycle does indeed exist,  and it is plotted in Fig. 8.6 for K=20. Experimentation with a wide range of initial  conditions shows that all trajectories do indeed approach the limit cycle asymptotically.  In addition, it is interesting to experiment with other values of K in (8.2) to determine the  stimulus range producing limit cycles.  8.3 FitzHugh-Nagumo equations  The simplest equations that have been proposed for spike generation are the FitzHugh- Nagumo equations. Like the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (see Chapter 9), these equations  have a threshold for generating limit cycles and thus provide a qualitative approximation  to spike generation thresholds. FitzHugh was well aware that his equations did not  provide a detailed model for action potentials but emphasized: 'For some purposes it is  useful to have a model of an excitable membrane that is mathematically as simple as  possible, even if experimental results are reproduced less accurately." (FitzHugh, 1969).  This simplicity will aid in studying limit cycle oscillations.  The FitzHugh (1961) and Nagumo et al. (1962) equations describe the interaction  between the voltage V across the axon membrane, which is driven by an input current  /input and a recovery variable R. R may be thought of as mainly reflecting the outward K+  current that results in hyperpolarization of the axon after each spike. As these variables  124  Spikes, decisions, and actions  are only qualitatively related to the underlying ion currents, different authors choose  slightly different parameter values in these equations. Here they will be written as:  dF  /  V1   n  r  — = 10 V- — - / { +/input  d '  V  3  ;  ( 8 8 )  AD  — = 0.8(-/J+ 1.25 V+ 1.5)  d?  Note that the time constant for V is 12.5 times faster than that for R (0.1 ms versus  1.25 ms), which reflects the fact that activation processes in the axon are much more rapid  than the recovery processes. The isocline equations are:  V  1  ' 'mpm  (8.9)  R= 1.25K+ 1.5  R — V -- - ± /lnput  For /input= 0' MatLab procedure roots shows that the only equilibrium point is:  V = -1.5  3  (8.10)  /? = - - The Jacobian is:  At equilibrium, therefore:  A =  l o - i o r 2  -IO  1  -0.8  —  / - P S  - I 0 \  A=(  j  _ 0 8 J  so  A = - 1 1 . 6 . - 1 . 7  (8.12)  Thus, in the absence of any input, the equilibrium is an asymptotically stable node. For  hyperpolarizing or inhibitory (negative) inputs /, the equilibrium remains an asympto- tically stable node, as the reader can easily verify.  For depolarizing (positive) /, the situation changes, however. As an example, let / = 1.5.  For this input, the only steady state is found from roots to be 1=0, R= 1.5, and (8.11)  shows that it is an unstable node. So, trajectories must leave some small region sur- rounding the steady slate. If we can now construct an outer closed boundary surrounding
