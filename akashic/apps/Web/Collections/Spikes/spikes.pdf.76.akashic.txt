becomes unstable. This is a Hopf bifurcation in which the steady state loses its stability to  the emerging, asymptotically stable limit cycle. A Hopf bifurcation at which an asymp- totically stable limit cycle emerges as the steady state becomes unstable is called a  supercritical bifurcation or a soft bifurcation. The particular one in Fig. 8.9 is sometimes  also called a 'pitchfork bifurcation' because of its shape. The alternative form of bifur- cation in which an unstable limit cycle merges with an asymptotically stable equilibrium  state, making it unstable, is depicted on the right of Fig. 8.9. This is termed a subcritical  bifurcation or a hard bifurcation. It will be seen in the next chapter that the Hodgkin- Huxley equations exhibit a subcritical bifurcation. Note that for both supercritical and  subcritical bifurcations, the limit cycle amplitude is infinitesimally small arbitrarily close  toj3 = a.  8.5 Delayed negative feedback  The Hopf bifurcation theorem provides an enormously powerful tool for demonstrating  the existence of limit cycles in dynamical systems in higher dimensions. Let us now apply it  to a four-dimensional example of a negative feedback circuit with delays. The delays will  be approximated by additional differential equations as developed in Chapter 4 and  130  Spikes, decisions, and actions  ©KD  Fig. 8.10  Negative feedback network with two delay stages, A, and A2 described by (8.  depicted in Fig. 8.10. Using A| and A: for the delay variables, the resulting system of  equations is:  dF  1  -  =  -(-E+S(K-A2))  dA, _ 1  ~dT~r  d/_ 1  d ?

For stimulus K= 350. the steady state can be  shown to be: F=50, /=300. Let us now linearize (8.18) around the steady state and  attempt to find a value of the delay time r at which a Hopf bifurcation occurs. The  Jacobian is:  ( •  V  1/20  1/T  (I  (i  0  -1/T  6/50  0  0  0  -1/50  1/T  -1/20X  0  0  -\/r  )  .19)  The Routh-Hurwitz criterion can be used to determine the critical value of r for which  (8.19) has a pair of pure imaginary roots. If you type this matrix into MatLab function  Hopf.m (this is why it was called Hopf!), save it, and then run Routh_Hur\vitz.m, you will  find that a Hopf bifurcation occurs when T— 10.74 ms and that the imaginary eigenvalues  are A= ±0.0556i, while the remaining two eigenvalues have negative real parts. Thus, a  Hopf bifurcation will produce a limit cycle with initial frequency 1000x0.0556/  (27r) = 8.85 Hz (the factor of 1000 converts from cycles/ms to cycles/s or Hz). To deter- mine the range of T values for which (8.18) has a limit cycle and to determine whether it is  asymptotically stable or unstable, run FBdelay.m with values of r near 10.74. You will  discover that the limit cycle is asymptotically stable for r > 10.74.  Nonlinear oscillations  131  This is a very important example, because it demonstrates that this simple neural  feedback system cannot oscillate if the transmission delays are very short. If, however, the  delays become long enough, limit cycle oscillations will occur. Whether these oscillations  are desirable or dysfunctional depends on the role that the feedback circuit plays in the  nervous system.  8.6 Adaptation and perceptual reversals  In Chapter 6 it was shown that spike rate adaptation in a short-term memory network  (6.14) could eventually cause the network activity to shut off; thereby losing the infor- mation in short-term memory. Will there be a similar effect if adaptation is introduced  into the two-neuron winner-take-all (WTA) network described by (6.18)? The network
