neurons (Ermentrout, 1998). Almost all mammalian neurons are Class I, while the squid  axon is of Class II.  The cortex of humans and other mammals is currently thought to contain four major  types of neurons, each of which is characterized by its distinctive nonlinear dynamical  properties. Spike shapes for two of these cell types, regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking  (FS), are plotted in Fig. 9.11C (McCormick et al., 1985). Action potentials of RS neurons  have a rapid rise but a much slower decay phase. FS cells, on the other hand, have a similar  rise but a much more rapid decay phase than regular-spiking cells, and in consequence, the  width of the spikes is significantly narrower. In humans, spike widths at half amplitude  average 0.95 ms for RS cells and 0.60 ms for FS cells (Wilson, 1999). The model in  eqn (9.10) has already been optimized to approximate the size and shape of RS neuron  action potentials obtained from human neocortical neurons, and a comparison between  model results and human data (Foehringe? al., 1991) is shown in Fig. 9.11A. The model  provides an accurate quantitative fit to the spike shape and, with the addition of a slow  potential to be discussed in the next chapter, to the spike rates as well. Equation (9.10) can  also provide an excellent quantitative approximation to the action potentials of FS cells if  just one parameter is changed: the recovery time constant must be reduced to TR = 2.1 ms.  150  Spikes, decisions, and actions  >  c  CD  O  Q- 4 0  2 0  0  2 0  4 0  6 0  8 0  1  - A  - i  1  i  i  ,,  - - 0 - - H u m a n  c\  1  yifDXD  |  - B  T  " • « - • •  I  •  i  // \ V  /' * \  :  //  M  =^^  FS  V V  •  I .

(C) FS and RS spike shapes recorded from neocortical neurons  (reproduced with permission, McCormick et al.. 1985).  This speed-up of the recovery phase by a factor of 2.7 produces the FS action potential  plotted in Fig. 9.1 IB. You can verify this by changing TauR in the MatLab script,  HumanNeuron.m. Note that the FS spike is not only narrower but also slightly reduced in  height relative to the RS cell, and this is also evident in the data in Fig. 9.11C. This is a  dynamical consequence of the faster R variable in the equations.  9.6 Subharmonic resonance and phase shifts  When the stimulus to a linear system is periodic with frequency u> the response is always  periodic at the same frequency. In nonlinear systems, however, limit cycles can respond at  subharmonics of the stimulus frequency, a phenomenon known as subharmonic reson- ance. Cochlear neurons in the auditory system exhibit subharmonic resonance in  response to pure tones of appropriate frequencies (Kiang et al., 1965). The phenomenon  of subharmonic resonance may be illustrated by the response of (9.7) to the periodic  stimulus / = ,4 sin(27rw?). If you run the MatLab script HHnoise.m with A =0.25,  SDnoise = 0 (noise is not relevant here) and u; = 200 Hz, the result at the top of Fig. 9.12  Action potentials and limit cycles  151  50  -50  -100  50  V(t)  -50  -100  50  -50  -100  200 Hz  400 Hz  VWXAAAAAAAAAA
