Equations for only two of the phase  oscillators, those controlling the left (9]) and right (92) front legs, are necessary here. The  equations for the hind legs become redundant, because quadruped trotting and galloping  both require that the hind leg on the same side of the animal be 180° out of phase with the  front leg. A simplified view of these two gaits is depicted in Fig. 13.5B. In trotting, each  diagonal pair of legs (e.g. left front and right hind) is in phase but is 180° out of phase with  the other diagonal pair. In galloping the phase locking switches so that the front legs are in  phase but 180° out of phase with the hind legs. The oscillator equations for the hind legs  are thus redundant because of the equalities:  02 + T,  0, = 0 1 +7T  (13.10)  These equations hold true (as idealizations) for both trotting and galloping, and sub- stitution into (13.9) yields:  d0,  ~d7  d02  ~d7  u - flsin(<r) + bs'm(92 - 9] + o) - rsin(02 - 0| + o)  ui - asin(fj) + 6sin(0i - 92+ o) - csin(0] — 92 + a)  113.11)  Swimming and traveling waves  217  where use has been made of the identity sin(.v + IT) = - sin(.v) for any x. This reduces the  network to a pair of coupled oscillators like those already considered. Proceeding as  before and setting 0 = 82 - 0, gives:  d0  — = (c - b) sin(0 + a) + (b - c)sin(-0 + a)  (13.12)  Setting d0/d? = 0, and using trigonometric identities for sin(±0 + a), shows that the  Phase-locked equilibrium states must satisfy:  (b - c) cos(tr) sin(0) = 0  (13.13)  As the synaptic delay a > 0, the solutions to (13.13) will be 0 = 0, it so long as b f^ c.  This shows that the four legs of the phase oscillator quadruped will be phase locked into  one of two gaits as long as the left-right coupling coefficient b is different from the  diagonal coupling coefficient c. The solution 0 = 0 produces a gallop in which the front  two legs are in phase, while 0 = IT corresponds to a trot in which the front two legs are out  of phase (and therefore given 13.10, the diagonal legs are in phase). To determine which  gait is asymptotically stable, let us carry out a linearized stability analysis on (13.12) for  0 = 0. The resulting linearized equation shows that 0 = 0 will be asymptotically stable if:  (b - c) cos(cr) > 0  (13.14)  If the inequality in this expression is reversed, then 0 = 0 is unstable, but 0 = n is
