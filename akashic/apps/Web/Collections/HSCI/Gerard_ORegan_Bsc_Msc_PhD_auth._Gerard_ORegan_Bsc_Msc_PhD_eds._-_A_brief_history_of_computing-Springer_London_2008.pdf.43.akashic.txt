period. The British had prosecuted the famous Irish playright, Oscar Wilde, in 1895 under Section 11 of the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act. This legislation pro- hibited acts of gross indecency between males. Turing had a brief relationship with Arnold Murray in the early 1950s. However, Murray and an accomplice burgled Turing’s house when the relationship ended in 1952. Turing reported the matter to the police, and at the criminal trial allegations of homosexuality were made against Turing. He was charged under the 1895 act and was convicted. He was then given a choice between imprisonment or probation. The terms of the probation were severe, and required him to receive oestrogen hormone injections for a year. There were side affects with the treatment and it led to depression and despair. Further, his conviction led to a removal of his security clearance and the end of his work on cryptography for the British government. Turing committed suicide in June 1954. The medical examiner noted that the cause of death was by cynanide poisoning caused by eating an apple that was laced with cyanide. Turing made outstanding contributions to mathematics, computer science, arti- ﬁcial intelligence and biology. The Association for Computing Machinery awards the annual “Turing Award” to individual who have made outstanding contributions to the computing ﬁeld. 2.6 Shannon Claude Shannon (Fig. 2.15) was born in Michigan in 1916. His primary degree was in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1936. He was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1940. His initial work at MIT was to improve his super- visor’s mechanical computing device known as the Differential Analyser by using electronic circuits rather than mechanical parts. Shannon’s research led to his insight that an electric circuit is similar to the Boolean Algebra that he had previously studied at the University of Michigan. The methods employed in the 1930s to design logic circuits were ad hoc. Shannon showed that Boolean algebra could be employed to simplify the design of circuits 56 2 Foundations Fig. 2.15 Claude Shannon and telephone routing switches.18 Shannon’s results helped to renew interest in the work of George Boole on Boolean algebra, as it was now evident that the Boolean concept of true and false could be employed to represent the functions of switches in electronic circuits. Shannon showed how to lay out circuitry according to Boolean principles, and his inﬂuential Masters thesis: “A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits” [Sha:37] became the foundation for the practical design of digital circuits. These circuits are fundamental to the operation of modern computers and telecommuni- cation systems, and Shannon’s Masters Thesis is a key milestone in the develop- ment of modern computers. Shannon’s insight of using the properties of electrical switches to do Boolean logic is the basic concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. 18 Boolean algebra was able to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays used in telephone switches. 2.6 Shannon 57 He moved to the Mathematics Department at Bell Labs in the 1940s and commenced work that would lead to the foundation of modern Information Theory. Information includes messages that occur in any communications medium, for example, television, radio, telephone, and computers. The fundamental problem of communication is to reproduce at a destination point either exactly or approximately a message that has been sent from a source point. The problem is that information may be distorted by noise and the message received may differ from that which was originally sent. Shannon provided a mathematical deﬁnition and framework for information the- ory that remains the standard today. The theory is described in “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” [Sha:48]. Shannon proposed the idea of converting any kind of data (e.g., pictures, sounds, or text) to binary digits: i.e., the data are reduced to binary bits of information. The information is then be transmitted over the com- munication medium. Errors or noise may be introduced during the transmission, and the objective is to reduce and correct errors. The received binary information is then converted back to the appropriate medium. Optimal communication of data is achieved by removing all randomness and redundancy. Shannon is therefore the father of digital communication as used by computers, His theory was an immediate success with communications engineers and its impact was far reaching. Shannon’s later work made a contribution to the ﬁeld of cryptogra- phy, and this is described in “Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems” [Sha:49]. Shannon also invented a chess playing computer program in 1948. Shannon retired at the age of 50 and died aged 84 in 2001. 2.6.1 Boolean Algebra and Switching Circuits Shannon showed that Boolean Algebra may be employed to design and analyse switching circuits. A circuit may be represented by a set of equations with the terms
