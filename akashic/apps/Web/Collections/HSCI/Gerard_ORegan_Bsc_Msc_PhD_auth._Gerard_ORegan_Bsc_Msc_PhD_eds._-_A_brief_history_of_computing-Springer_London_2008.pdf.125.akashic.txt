IBM had until then provided a complete business solution to its clients with gen- erally one key business person making the decision to purchase the IBM computer system for the company. The personal computer market and the client–server archi- tecture had now fragmented this traditional market, as departments and individuals could now make their own purchasing decisions. The traditional customer relation- ship that IBM had with its clients had been fundamentally altered. It took IBM some time to adjust to this changing world, and it incurred huge losses of over $8 billion in 1993. The company embarked on cost cutting measures as it worked to adapt to the new environment. This involved reducing its work force, rebuilding IBM’s product line, and major cost reductions. IBM’s strength in providing integrated business solutions proved to be an asset in adapting to the brave new world. IBM faced further challenges to adapt to the rise of the Internet and to network computing. The internet was another dramatic shift in the computing industry, but IBM was better prepared this time after its painful adjustment in the client/server market. IBM’s leadership helped to create the e-business revolution, and IBM actu- ally coined the term “e-business”. IBM outlined to customers and to its employees how the Internet had the ability to challenge older business models, and to transform the nature of transactions between businesses and individuals. IBM created the world’s fastest and most powerful general purpose computer in 1994. This was a massively parallel computer capable of performing 136 bil- lion calculations per second. The increase in computational power of computers was becoming phenomenal. The Deep Blue computer programmed chess program defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997 (Fig. 7.8). Kasparov was then the existing world champion in chess, and the IBM victory showed that the computational power of computers could match or exceed that of man. It was also the ﬁrst time that a com- puter had defeated a top-ranked chess player in tournament play. Deep Blue had phenomenal calculating power, and it could calculate 200 million chess moves per second. IBM and the US Energy Department introduced Blue Paciﬁc which was the world’s fastest computer in 1998. It was capable of performing 3.9 trillion calcu- lations per second and had over 2.6 trillion bytes of memory. An indication of its computability is given by the fact that the amount of calculations that this machine could perform in one second would take a person using a calculator over 63,000 years. 216 7 Famous Technology Companies Fig. 7.8 Deep Blue Processors Courtesy of IBM archives. The Year-2000 millennium bug generated signiﬁcant customer demand in the late 1990s, as customers wished to ensure that their software was compliant and would continue to function correctly in the new millennium. January 1, 2000 went smoothly for most companies as they had converted their legacy software systems to be Year-2000 compliant. IBM is a highly innovative company and is awarded more patents6 in the United States than any other company. It earned over 3,000 patents in 2004. The company is a household name and it has a long and distinguished history. The history of computing is, in many ways, closely related to the history of IBM, as the company has played a key role in the development of the computers that we are familiar with today. 7.3 Microsoft Microsoft was created by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 (Fig. 7.9). Steve Ballmer joined the company in 1980. The ﬁrst real success of the company was with the Disk Operating System (DOS) for personal computers. IBM had originally intended awarding the contract for the operating system to Digital Research use a version of Digital’s CP/M operating system on the forthcoming IBM Personal Computer. However, negotiations between IBM and Digital failed in 1981, and IBM awarded the contract to Microsoft to produce a version of the CP/M operating system for its personal computers. 6 A patent is legal protection that is given to an inventor, and allows the inventor to exploit the invention for a ﬁxed period of time (typically 20 years). 7.3 Microsoft 217 Fig. 7.9 Bill Gates Photo courtesy of Wikipedia. Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called QDOS to assist with this, and IBM renamed the new operating system to PC-DOS. Microsoft created its own version of the operating system called MS-DOS, and the deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative. This proved to be a major mistake by IBM, as MS-DOS became popular in Europe, Japan and South America. The ﬂood of PC clones on the market allowed Microsoft to gain major market share through aggressive marketing of its operating system to the various manufacturers of the cloned PCs. This led to Microsoft becoming a major player in the personal computer market. The company released its ﬁrst version of Microsoft Word in 1983, and this would
