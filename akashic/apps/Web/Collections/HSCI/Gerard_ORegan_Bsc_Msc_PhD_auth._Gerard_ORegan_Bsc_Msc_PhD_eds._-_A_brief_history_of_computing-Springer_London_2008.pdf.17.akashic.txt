with fractions (in base 60) and in multiplying fractions. They maintained tables of reciprocals (i.e., 1/n, n = 1, . . . 59 apart from numbers like 7, 11, etc., which are not of the form 2α3β5γ and cannot be written as a ﬁnite sexagesimal expansion). Babylonian numbers are represented in the more modern sexagesimal notation developed by Neugebauer (who translated many of the Babylonian cuneiforms) [Res:84]. The approach is as follows: 1;24,51,10 represents the number 1+24/60+ 51/3600 + 10/216000 = 1 + 0.4 + 0.0141666 + 0.0000462 = 1.4142129 and is the Babylonian representation of the square root of 2. The Babylonians performed multiplication as the following calculation of (20) ∗(1; 24, 51, 10) i.e., 20 ∗sqrt(2) illustrates: 20∗1 = 20 20∗; 24 = 20∗24 60 = 8 20∗51 3600 = 51 180 = 17 60 =; 17 20∗ 10 216000 = 3 3600 + 20 216000 =; 0, 3, 20 Hence the product 20 ∗sqrt(2) = 20; +8; +; 17+; 0, 3, 20 = 28; 17, 3, 20 The Babylonians appear to have been aware of Pythagoras’s Theorem about 1000 years before the time of Pythagoras. The Plimpton 322 tablet records various 8 A positional numbering system is a number system where each position is related to the next by a constant multiplier. The decimal system is an example: e.g., 546 = 5∗102 + 4∗101 + 6. 6 1 Early Civilisations Fig. 1.1 The plimpton 322 tablet Pythagorean triples, i.e., triples of numbers (a, b, c) where a2 + b2 = c2 (Fig. 1.1). It dates from approximately 1700 BC They developed algebra to assist with problem solving, and their algebra allowed problems involving length, breadth and area to be discussed and solved. They did not employ notation for representation of unknown values (e.g., let x be the length and y be the breadth), and instead they used words like “length” and “breadth”. They were familiar with and used square roots in their calculations, and while they were familiar with techniques to solve quadratic equations. They were familiar with various mathematical identities such as (a +b)2 = (a2+ 2ab +b2) as illustrated geometrically in Fig. 1.2. They also worked on astronomical problems, and they had mathematical theories of the cosmos to make predictions of when eclipses and other astronomical events would occur. They were also interested in astrology, and they associated various deities with the heavenly bodies such as the planets, as well as the sun and moon. Various cluster of stars with associated with familiar creatures such as lions, goats, and so on. The earliest form of counting by the Babylonians was done using ﬁngers. They improved upon this by developing counting boards to assist with counting and Fig. 1.2 Geometric representation of (a + b)2 = (a2 + 2ab + b2) a2 a b ab ab a+b b2 1.3 The Egyptians 7 simple calculations. A counting board is an early version of the abacus, and it was usually made of wood or stone. The counting board contained grooves which allowed beads or stones could be moved along the groove. The abacus differed from counting boards in that the beads in abaci contained holes that enabled them to be placed in a particular rod of the abacus. 1.3 The Egyptians The Egyptian Civilization developed along the Nile from about 4000 BC and lasted until the Roman Empire. The achievements of the Egyptian civilization are remark- able and their engineers built the gigantic pyramids at Giza near Cairo around 3000 BC. The Egyptians used mathematics to solve practical problems. This included mea- suring time, measuring the annual Nile ﬂooding, calculating the area of land, solving cooking and baking problems, book keeping and accounting, and calculating taxes. They developed a calendar circa 4000 BC. It consisted of 12 months, and each month had 30 days. There were then ﬁve extra feast days to give 365 days in a year.
