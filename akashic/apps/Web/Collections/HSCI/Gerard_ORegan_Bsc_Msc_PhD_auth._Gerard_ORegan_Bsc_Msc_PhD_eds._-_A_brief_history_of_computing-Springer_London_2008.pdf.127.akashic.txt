in 1998. These documents went into detail of the threat that open source software posed to Microsoft and also mentioned possible legal action against Linux and other open source software. Windows 2000 was released in early 2000 and included enhanced multime- dia capabilities. The legal action taken by the US Department of Justice against Microsoft concluded in mid-2000, and the judgement called the company an “abu- sive monopoly”. The judgment stated that the company should be split into two parts. However, this ruling was subsequently overturned on appeal. The company released Windows XP in 2001. Microsoft launched its .NET initiative in 2002 and this is a new API for Windows programming. It includes a new programming language called C#. Microsoft also released a new version of the Visual Studio development product in 2002. Microsoft Vista is due to be released in 2007. 7.4 Motorola Motorola7 was originally founded as the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928. Paul Galvin and his brother Joseph purchased a battery eliminator business in Chicago. They incorporated Galvin Manufacturing Corporation later that year. The company initially had ﬁve employees and its ﬁrst product was a battery eliminator. This was a device that allows battery-powered radios to run on standard household electric current. The company introduced one of the ﬁrst commercially successful car radios in 1930. This was the Motorola model 5T71 radio and it sold for between $110 and $130. Paul Galvin created the brand name “Motorola” in 1930. The origin of the name is from “Motor” to highlight the company’s new car radio, and the sufﬁx “ola” was in common use for audio equipment at the time. 7 This section is dedicated to the staff of the late Motorola plant in Blackrock, Cork, Ireland. Motorola set up a plant in Cork in the mid-1980s and at its peak it employed over 500 skilled software engineer and I was impressed by their professionalism and dedication to customer satis- faction. The plant developed the Operations and Maintenance Centre (OMC) which is a key part of the GSM system. 220 7 Famous Technology Companies Motorola has come a long way since then and it is now a global leader in wire- less, broadband and automotive communications technologies. It is internationally recognized for its innovation, excellence and its dedication to customer satisfaction. It has played a leading role in transforming the way in which people communicate, and the company has been a leader rather than a follower in technology. Its engineers have developed innovative products and services to connect people to each other. Motorola’s products have evolved over the years in response to changing cus- tomers’ needs. Many of its products have been radio-related, starting with a battery eliminator for radios, to the ﬁrst walkie-talkies, to cellular infrastructure equipment and mobile phones. The company was also strong in semiconductor technology,8 including integrated circuits used in computers. This included the microprocessors used in the Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh computers. The Power PC chip was developed in partnership with IBM. Motorola has a diverse line of communica- tion products, including satellite systems and digital cable boxes. The company is renowned for its dedication to quality and customer satisfaction. It deﬁned and implemented the original Six SigmaTMquality principles in 1983. Motorola was awarded the ﬁrst Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award granted by the US Department of Commerce in 1988 in recognition of its work on 6-sigma. The three commandments of six sigma philosophy are: r The company needs to be focused on the Customer (and on Customer Satisfac- tion). r Data must be gathered to provide visibility into performance with respect to the key goals and performance of the processes. r Variation in processes needs to be eliminated (as variation leads to quality prob- lems). The use of Six Sigma by Jack Welsh within General Electric is well-known. Six- Sigma is a rigorous customer-focused, data-driven management approach to busi- ness improvement. Its objectives are to eliminate defects from every product and process, and to improve processes to do things better, faster and at a lower cost. It can be used to improve every activity and step of the business that is concerned with cost, timeliness and quality of results. It is designed to provide tangible busi- ness results directly related to the bottom line of the company. Motorola University provides training on six sigma. 7.4.1 Early Years Motorola was founded as the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928 and its ﬁrst product was the battery eliminator.
