Turing contributed to the debate concerning artiﬁcial intelligence in his 1950 paper on Computing, machinary and intelligence [Tur:50]. Turing’s paper considered whether it could be possible for a machine to be conscious and to think. He predicted that it would be possible to speak of “thinking machines”, and he devised a famous experiment that would allow a computer to be judged as a conscious and thinking machine. This is known as the “Turing Test”. The test itself is an adaptation of a well-known party game which involves three participants. One of them, the judge, is placed in a separate room from the other two: one is a male and the other is a female. Questions and responses are typed and passed under the door. The objective of the game is for the judge to determine which participant is male and which is female. The male is allowed to deceive the judge whereas the female is supposed to assist. Turing adapted this game by allowing the role of the male to be played by a computer. If the judge could not tell which of the two participants was human or machine, then the computer could be considered intelligent. That is, if a computer can convince a human that it is also a human, then the machine must also be con- sidered to be intelligent and to have passed the “Turing Test”. The test is applied to test the linguistic capability of the machine rather than to the audio capability, and the conversation between the judge and the parties is conducted over a text only channel. 54 2 Foundations Turing’s work on “thinking machines” caused a great deal of public controversy, as defenders of traditional values attacked the idea of machine intelligence. Tur- ing’s paper led to a debate concerning the nature of intelligence. There has been no machine developed, to date, that has passed the Turing test, and there is unlikely to be one in the near future. Turing strongly believed that machines would eventually be developed that would stand a good chance of passing the “Turing Test”. He considered the opera- tion of “thought” to be equivalent to the operation of a discrete state machine. Such a machine may be simulated by a program that runs on a single, universal machine, i.e. a computer. He did consider various objections to his position on artiﬁcial intel- ligence, and attempted to refute these objections in his 1950 paper. These include (Table 2.7): Table 2.7 Turing and AI Argument Description Theological Objections God has given an immortal soul to every man and woman. Thinking is a function of man’s immortal soul. God has not given an immortal soul to animals or inanimate machines. Therefore, animals or machines cannot think. Head in the Sand objections The consequences of thinking machines would be dreadful to mankind. Let us hope that this never happens as it would undermine the superiority of man over animals and machines. Mathematical Objections There is a limitation to the power of discrete machines, and consequently there are certain things that these machines cannot do. Goedel’s Theorem is one example of a limitation of what machines may do. However, there are also limits on what humans may do. Consciousness The argument is that a machine cannot feel or experience emotion such as joy, anger, happiness, and so on. Turing argued that this position is similar to the difﬁculty in knowing that other humans can experience emotions. Lady Lovelace’s objection This comes from a statement made by Lady Lovelace that the Analytic Engine can do only whatever we know or tell it to do. In other words, a machine can never do anything really new. However, as Turing points out, machines and computers often surprise us with new results. Informality of Behaviour This argument is along the lines that if each man has a set of laws (or rules of behaviour) that regulate his life then he would be no better than a machine. But there are no such rules and therefore men cannot be machines. However, the statement that there are no such rules or laws of behaviour is debatable. Learning Machines If a machine is to possess human like intelligence it will need to be capable of learning. That is, the machine will need to be a learning machine that acquires knowledge by experience as well as having an initial core set of knowledge inserted into the machine. Turing argued that researchers should aim to produce a computer with a child like mind and develop the knowledge of the computer by teaching it. 2.6 Shannon 55 There are a number of recent objections to the Turing test, including Searle’s Chi- nese room argument, and this essentially argues that the simulation of human lan- guage behaviour is weaker than true intelligence. This is discussed in a later chapter. Turing later did some work in biology in the area of morphology which is con- cerned with the form and structure of plants and animals. 2.5.4 Later Life Turing was a homosexual and the Victorian laws in England still applied during this
