in the ﬁfth meditation in his Mediations on First Philosophy [Des:99] is that we have an innate idea of a supremely perfect being (God), and that God’s existence may be inferred immediately from the innate idea of a supremely perfect being. The argument may be summarised as follows: 1. I have an innate idea of a supremely perfect being (i.e. God). 2. Necessarily, existence is a perfection. 3. Therefore God exists. He then argued that as God is benevolent that he can have some trust in the reality that his senses provide, as God has provided him with a thinking mind and does not wish to deceive him. He then argued that knowledge of the external world can be obtained by both perception and deduction. In other words, he argues that rea- son or rationalism is the only reliable method of obtaining knowledge. Descartes arguments provided an answer to the school of scepticism that held the view that knowledge, and knowledge of existence of the external world was impossible. Descartes was a dualist and he makes a clear mind-body distinction.2 He states that there are two substances in the universe: mental substances and bodily sub- stances. His proof of the existence of God and the external world are controver- sial and have been criticised by the sceptics and others. One well known argument against Descartes is the “the brain in the vat” argument. This is a thought experiment in which a mad scientist removes a person’s brain from their body and places it in a vat and connects its neurons by wires to a supercomputer. The computer provides the disembodied brain with the electrical impulses that the brain would normally receive. The computer could then simulate reality, and the disembodied brain would have conscious experiences and would receive the same impulses as if it were inside a person’s skull. There is no way to tell whether the brain is inside the vat or inside a person. The perception of a “cat” in the ﬁrst case reﬂects the reality. However, for the second case where the brain is in the vat the perception is false, and does not correspond to reality. Since it is impossible to know whether your brain is in a vat or inside your skull it is therefore impossible to know whether your belief is valid or not. Descartes believed that the bodies of animals are complex living machines without feelings. He dissected many animals for experiments and this included 2 The mind-body distinction is very relevant in AI. The human mind may be considered to be a piece of software which the human brain implements. Therefore, in principle, it should be possible to code this program on a von Neumann computer yielding a mental machine. Cognitive science was originally based on this paradigm. 154 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems vivisection (i.e., the cutting up of live animals). Vivisection has become contro- versial in recent years on ethical grounds, and the question is whether it right that animals should be used and subject to suffering to further human interests. This debate has centred on whether animals have rights being animals given that humans have inalienable rights being human. Others have argued against vivisection claim- ing that it is not necessary in scientiﬁc research. Some have argued for vivisection on utilitarian grounds, with others stating that animals have rights, and should not be used as means to an end, irrespective of the expected beneﬁts to humans. Descartes experiments led him to believe that the actions and behaviour of non- human animals can be fully accounted for by mechanistic means, and without refer- ence to the operations of the mind. Descartes also realised from his experiments that a lot of human behaviour is like that of animals in that it has a mechanistic expla- nation. For example, physiological functions and blinking are human behaviours that have a mechanistic explanation. Descartes was of the view that well-designed automata3 could mimic many parts of human behaviour. He argued that the key differentiators between human and animal behaviour were that humans could adapt to widely varying situations, and also had the ability to use language. The use of lan- guage illustrates the power of the use of thought, and it clearly differentiates humans from animals. Animals do not possess the ability to use language for communication or reason. This, he argues, provides evidence for the presence of a soul associated with the human body. In essence, animals are pure machines, whereas humans are machines with minds (or souls). Descartes was strongly against attributing minds to animals as it would under- mine religious belief. The ascribing of thought to animals involves giving them immortal souls, since Descartes considered mental substances to be indivisible. Descartes associated the concept of mind with the Christian concept of the soul, and he argued that if animals had minds (or souls) then man’s hope for an afterlife
