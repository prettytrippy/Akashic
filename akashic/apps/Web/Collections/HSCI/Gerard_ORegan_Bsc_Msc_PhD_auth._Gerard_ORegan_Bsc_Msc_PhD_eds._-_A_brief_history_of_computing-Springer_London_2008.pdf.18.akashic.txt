Egyptians writings were recorded on the walls of temples and tombs9 and were also recorded on a reed like parchment termed “papyrus”. There are three well-known Egyptian scripts namely the well-known hieroglyphics writing system; the hieratic script; and the demotic script. The deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphics was done by Champollion with his work on the Rosetta stone. The latter was discovered during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt, and is now in the British Museum in London. It contains three scripts: Hieroglyphics, Demotic script and Greek. The key to the decipherment was that the Rosetta stone contained just one name “Ptolemy” in the Greek text, and this was identiﬁed with the hieroglyphic characters in the cartouche10 of the hieroglyph- ics. There was just one cartouche on the Rosetta stone, and Champollion inferred that the cartouche represented the name “Ptolemy”. He was familiar with another multi-lingual object which contained two names in the cartouche. One he recognised as Ptolemy and the other he deduced from the Greek text as “Cleopatra”. This led to the breakthrough in translation of the hieroglyphics [Res:84]. The Egyptians writing system is based on hieroglyphs and dates from 3000 BC. Hieroglyphs are little pictures and are used to represent words, alphabetic characters as well as syllables or sounds. The Rhind Papyrus is one of the most famous Egyptian papyri on mathematics. It was purchased by the Scottish Egyptologist, Henry Rhind, in 1858 and is now in the British museum. The papyrus is a copy and it was created by an Egyptian 9 The decorations of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings record the life of the pharaoh including his exploits and successes in battle. 10 The cartouche surrounded a group of hieroglyphic symbols enclosed by an oval shape. Cham- pollion’s insight was that the group of hieroglyphic symbols represented the name of the Ptolemaic pharaoh “Ptolemy”. 8 1 Early Civilisations scribe called Ahmose.11 It was originally six meters in length, and it is believed to date to 1832 BC. It contains examples of all kinds of arithmetic and geometric problems, and it was probably intended to be used by students as a textbook to develop their mathematical knowledge. This would allow the students to participate in the pharaoh’s building programme. There is another well known papyrus known as the Moscow papryrus. The Egyptian priests had were familiar with geometry, arithmetic and elementary algebra. They had formulae to ﬁnd solutions to problems with one or two unknowns. A bases 10 number system was employed separate with symbols for one, ten, a hun- dred, a thousand, a ten thousand, a hundred thousand, and so on. These hieroglyphic symbols are represented in Fig. 1.3 below: Fig. 1.3 Egyptian numerals For example, the representation of the number 276 in Egyptian Hieroglyphics is given in Fig. 1.4: Fig. 1.4 Egyptian representation of a number The addition of two numerals is straight forward and involves adding the indi- vidual symbols, and where there are ten copies of a symbol it is then replaced by a single symbol of the next higher value. The Egyptian employed unit fractions (e.g., 1/n where n is an integer). These were represented in hieroglyphs by placing the symbol representing a “mouth” above the number. The symbol “mouth” represents part of. For example, the representation of the number 1/276 is given in Fig. 1.5: Fig. 1.5 Egyptian representation of a fraction The problems on the papyrus included the determination of the angle of the slope of the pyramid’s face. The Egyptians were familiar with trigonometry includ- ing sine, cosine, tangent and cotangent. They knew how to build right angles into 11 The Rhind papyrus is sometimes referred to as the Ahmes papyrus in honour of the scribe who wrote it in 1832 BC. 1.4 The Greeks 9 their structures and used the ratio 3:4:5. The Rhind Papyrus also considers practical problems such as how many loaves of bread can be baked from a given quantity of grain. Other problems included calculating the number of bricks required for part of a building project. The Egyptians were familiar with addition, subtraction, multipli- cation and division. However, their multiplication and division was cumbersome as they could only multiply and divide by two. Suppose they wished to multiply a number n by 7. Then n ∗7 is determined by
