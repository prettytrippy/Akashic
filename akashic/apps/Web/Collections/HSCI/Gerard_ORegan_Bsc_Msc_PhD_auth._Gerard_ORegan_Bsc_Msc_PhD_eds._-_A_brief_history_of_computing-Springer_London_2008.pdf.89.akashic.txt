A simpliﬁed test process is sketched in Fig. 4.10: Metrics are generally maintained to provide visibility into the effectiveness of the testing process. Testing is described in more detail in [ORg:02]. 4.7 Process Maturity Models The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) in the early 1990s as a framework to help software organizations to improve their software process maturity, and to implement best practice in software and sys- tems engineering. The SEI and many quality experts believe that there is a close rela- tionship between the maturity of software processes and the quality of the delivered software product. The CMM built upon the work of quality gurus such as Dem- ing [Dem:86] (Fig. 4.11), Juran [Jur:2000] (Fig. 4.12) and Crosby [Crs:79] whose ideas had been very effective in transforming manufacturing companies to produce high quality products and in reducing the costs associated with reworking defective products. They recognized a need to focus on the process, and software organisations need to focus on the software development process as well as the product. Early work on the CMM was done by Watts Humphrey at IBM [Hum:89] (Fig. 4.13). Humphrey moved to the SEI in the late 1980s, and worked with the other SEI experts to produce the ﬁrst version of the CMM in 1991. The model has been developed further in recent years and it is now called the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI R⃝) [CKS:03]. The CMMI consists of ﬁve maturity levels with each maturity level (except level one) consisting of several process areas. Each process area consists of a set of goals that must be satisﬁed for the process area to be satisﬁed. The goals for the process area are implemented by practices related to that process area, and the implementa- tion of these practices lead to an effective process. Processes need to be deﬁned and documented. The users of the process need to receive appropriate training to enable them to carry out the process, and processes need to be enforced by independent audits. The emphasis on level two of the CMMI is on maturing management prac- tices such as project management, requirements management, conﬁguration 144 4 Software Engineering Fig. 4.11 W.

This maturity level includes peer reviews and testing, requirements development, software design and implementation practices, and so on. Level four is concerned with ensuring that key processes are performing within strict quantitative limits, and adjusting processes, where necessary, to per- form within these deﬁned limits. Level ﬁve is concerned with continuous process improvement which is quantitatively veriﬁed. Maturity levels may not be skipped in the staged implementation of the CMMI. There is also a continuous representation of the CMMI which allows the orga- nization to focus on improvements to key processes. However, in practice it is often necessary to implement several of the level two process areas before serious work can be done on implementing a process at a higher maturity level. The use of metrics [Fen:95, Glb:76] becomes more important as an organization matures, as metrics allow the performance of an organization to be objectively judged. The higher CMMI maturity levels set quantitative levels for processes to perform within. The CMMI allows organizations to benchmark themselves against other similar organizations. This is done by formal SEI approved SCAMPI appraisals conducted 4.7 Process Maturity Models 145 Fig. 4.12 W. Joseph Juran Courtesy of Juran Institute.

The results of a SCAMPI appraisal are generally reported back to the SEI, and there is a strict qualiﬁcation process to become an authorized SCAMPI lead appraiser. An appraisal is useful in verifying that an organization has improved, and it enables the organisation to prioritise improvements for the next improvement cycle.
