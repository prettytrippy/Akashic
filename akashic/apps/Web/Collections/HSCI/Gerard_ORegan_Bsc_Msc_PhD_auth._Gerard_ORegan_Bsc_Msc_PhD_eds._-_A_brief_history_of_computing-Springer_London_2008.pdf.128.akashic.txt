successful car radios in 1930. This was the 5T71 radio and it was installed in most automobiles. The company entered the ﬁeld of mobile radio communications in 1936 with the development of the Motorola Police Cruiser mobile receiver. This product was preset to a single frequency and allowed vehicles to receive police broadcasts. Motorola’s roots are in radio technology, and its core expertise in radio enabled it to become a leader in mobile phone communications in the mid-1980s. The company entered the home radio business in 1937 and its products included phonographs (for playing recorded music) and home radios. It developed a lightweight two-way radio system in 1940 that was used for communication during the Second World War. It introduced its ﬁrst commercial line of Motorola FM two-way radio systems and equipment in 1941. It introduced its ﬁrst television for the home entertainment business in 1947. This was the Golden View model VT71 and it was priced under $200. The Galvin Man- ufacturing Corporation ofﬁcially became Motorola, Inc., in 1947 and it introduced its well known logo in 1955. It established a research centre in Arizona to investigate the potential of new technologies such as the transistor. It would become one of the largest manufac- tures of semi-conductors in the world. However, its semi-conductor product sector became a separate company (Freescale Semiconductor Inc.) in 2003. Motorola’s ﬁrst mass-produced semiconductor was a transistor intended for car radios. The company introduced a pager in 1956 that allowed radio messages to be sent to a particular individual. Motorola’s radio equipment (including a radio transponder) was used by Neil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 lunar module for two-way voice communication on the moon. A Motorola FM radio receiver was used on NASA’s lunar roving vehicle to provide a voice link between the Earth and the moon. Motorola presented a prototype for the world’s ﬁrst portable telephone in 1973. The DynaTAC (Dynamic Adoptive Total Area Coverage) used a radio technology called cellular. The company would spend $100 million in the development of cel- lular technology, and commercial services of DynaTAC commenced in 1983. The ﬁrst DynaTAC phone became available to consumers in 1984 and weighed almost 2 lbs. Motorola made a strategic decision in 1974 to sell off its radio and television manufacturing division. The television manufacturing division produced the Quasar product line. Quasar was sold as a separate brand from Motorola, and all Motorola manufactured televisions were sold as “Quasar”. The Quasar division was sold to Matsushita who were already well-known for the Panasonic television brand. The Matsushita acquisition of Motorola’s Quasar division was the beginning of the end of the manufacturing of televisions by US companies. Motorola televisions were transistorized coloured models that contained all of the serviceable parts in a drawer beneath the television. However, they had qual- ity problems. The new Japanese management succeeded in producing televisions with signiﬁcantly higher quality than Motorola and they had 5% of the defects of Motorola manufactured televisions. Motorola’s executives later visited the Quasar plant near Chicago and were amazed at the quality and performance improvements. 222 7 Famous Technology Companies The Japanese had employed the principles of total quality management based on Deming and Juran, and had focused on improvements to the process. This had led signiﬁcant cost savings as less time was spent in reworking defective televisions. The Japanese quality professionals had recognized that the cost of poor quality was considerable, and their strategy was to focus on the prevention of defects at their source. This led to a dramatic reduction in the number of defects, and a correspond- ing reduction in the costs of correcting the defects. The Motorola executives were amazed at the correlation between cost and quality, and this motivated the six-sigma quality improvement programme in Motorola. There were allegations that the acquisition by Matsushita of Quasar was nothing more than a Japanese strategy to avoid paying tariffs on television sets imported into the United States. The “Quasar” brand was considered to be domestically made even though Quasar’s engineering and manufacturing division was being scaled down. The Quasar televisions produced consisted of Japanese parts as the company moved away from engineering in the United States and focused on assembly and distribution. 7.4.2 Six-Sigma The CEO of Motorola established the “Five Year Ten Fold Improvement Pro- gramme” as one of the top-10 goals of the company in 1981. This was a commitment by senior management to achieve signiﬁcant quality and performance improvements to its products and services over the next 5 years. The roots of six-sigma as a measurement standard goes back to the eighteenth century German mathematician Gauss. He introduced the concept of the normal
