as the Sieve of Eratosthenes and the steps are as follows: 1. Write a list of the numbers from 2 to the largest number that you wish to test for primality. This ﬁrst list is called A. 14 The town of Aswan is famous today for the Aswan high dam which was built in the 1960s. There was an older Aswan dam built by the British in the late nineteenth century. The new dam led to a rise in the water level of Lake Nasser and ﬂooding of archaeological sites along the Nile. Several sites such as Abu Simbel and the island of Philae were relocated to higher ground. 14 1 Early Civilisations 2. A second list B is created to list the primes. It is initially empty. 3. The number 2 is the ﬁrst prime number and is added to the list of primes in B. 4. Strike off (or remove) all multiples of 2 from List A. 5. The ﬁrst remaining number in List A is a prime number and this prime number is added to List B. 6. Strike off (or remove) this number and all multiples of this number from List A. 7. Repeat steps 5 through 7 until no more numbers are left in List A. Comment 1.2 The Sieve of Eratosthenes method is a well-known algorithm for determining prime numbers. Computing students often implement this algorithm as an early computer assignment. Archimedes was a mathematician, astronomer and philosopher who lived in Syracuse. He is famous for his discovery of the law of buoyancy that is known as Archimedes’s principle: The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the displaced ﬂuid. Archimedes is believed to have discovered the principle while sitting in his bath He was so overwhelmed with his discovery that he rushed out onto the streets of Syra- cuse shouting “Eureka”, but forgot to put on his clothes to announce the discovery. The weight of the displaced liquid will be proportional to the volume of the dis- placed liquid. Therefore, if two objects have the same mass, the one with greater vol- ume (or smaller density) has greater buoyancy. An object will ﬂoat if its buoyancy force (i.e., the weight of liquid displaced) exceeds the downward force of gravity (i.e., its weight). If the object has exactly the same density as the liquid, then it will stay still, neither sinking nor ﬂoating upwards. For example, a rock is generally a very dense material and will generally not displace its own weight. Therefore, a rock will sink to the bottom as the downward weight exceeds the buoyancy weight. However, it the weight of the object is less than the liquid it would displace then it ﬂoats at a level where it displaces the same weight of liquid as the weight of the object. Archimedes also made good contributions to mathematics including a good approximation to π, contributions to the positional numbering system, geometric series, and to maths physics. He also solved several interesting problems: e.g., the calculation of the composition of cattle in the herd of the Sun god by solving a num- ber of simultaneous Diophantine equations. The herd consisted of bulls and cows with one part of the herd consisting of white, second part black, third spotted and the fourth brown. Various constraints were then expressed in Diophantine equations and the problem was to determine the precise composition of the herd. Diophantine equations are named after Diophantus worked who worked on number theory in the third century. Archimedes also worked on another interesting problem to determine the number of grains of sands in the known universe. He challenged the prevailing view that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted, and in order to provide an upper bound he needed to develop a naming system for large numbers. The largest number in common use at the time was a myriad (100 million) and a myriad is 1.4 The Greeks 15 10,000. Archimedes’ numbering system goes up to 8∗1016 and he also developed the laws of exponents: i.e., 10a10b = 10a+b. His calculation of the upper bound includes not only the grains of sand on each beach but on the earth ﬁlled with sand and the known universe ﬁlled with sand. His ﬁnal estimate of the number of grains of sand in a ﬁlled universe is an upper bound of 1064 for the number of grains of sand in a ﬁlled universe. Is is possible that he may have developed the odometer,15 and this instrument could calculate the total distance travelled on a journey. An odometer is described by the Roman engineer Vitruvius around 25 BC. It employed a wheel with a diameter
