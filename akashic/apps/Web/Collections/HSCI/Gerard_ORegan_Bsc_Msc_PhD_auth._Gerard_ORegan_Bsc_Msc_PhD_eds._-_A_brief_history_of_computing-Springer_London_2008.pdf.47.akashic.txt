the objects that the predicate will apply to: i.e., the set of natural numbers. The objects that a predicate may be applied will not include any object that is deﬁned in terms of the predicate itself (as they are of different types). Von Neumann’s contribution in his PhD thesis was to show how the contradiction in set theory can be avoided in two ways. One approach is to employ the axiom of foundation, and the other approach is to employ the concept of a class. The axiom of foundation speciﬁes that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in a sequence of steps such that if one set belongs to another then it must come before the second in the sequence. He showed that the addition of this new axiom to the other axioms of set theory did not produce a contradiction. His second approach was to employ the concept of a class, and to deﬁne a set as a class which belongs to other classes. A proper class is a class that does not belong to any other class. The class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed. However, it is a proper class and is not a set. Von Neumann next considered the problem of the axiomatization of quantum theory. The axiomatization of physical theories was listed as one of the key problems to be solved by Hilbert in 1900. Hilbert had presented his famous list of twenty-three problems at the international congress of mathematics in 1900. Quantum mechan- ics had deep foundational and philosophical issues especially with respect to non- determinism. The two existing formulations for quantum mechanics were the wave mechanical formulation by Schr¨odinger, and the matrix mechanical formulation by Heisenberg. However, there was no single theoretical formulation. Von Neumann developed an elegant mathematical theory that showed how the physics of Quantum Theory could be reduced to the mathematics of linear opera- tors on Hilbert spaces [VN:32]. The theory formulated by Von Neumann included the Sch¨odinger and Heisenberg formulations as special cases. Heisenberg’s Uncer- tainty principle with respect to position and the momentum of microscopic particles was translated to the non-commutativity of two operators. Von Neumann’s work in Quantum Mechanics was very inﬂuential. However, many physicists preferred an alternate approach formulated by Dirac which involved the use of the Diral Delta function. Von Neumann and Birkhoff later proved that quantum mechanics requires 2.7 Von Neumann 65 a logic that is quite different from classical logic. For example, the commutativity of Boolean algebra is no longer valid. That is, A ∧B ̸= B ∧A. Similarly, the distributive laws are no longer valid. Von Neumann was a private lecturer in Germany between 1926 and 1930. He moved to the United States in the early 1930s to take a position as professor of mathematics at the newly formed Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton in New Jersey. He became an American citizen in 1937 and remained at Princeton for the rest of his life. Von Neumann made contributions to Economics and showed how game theory and the theory of equilibria could be used in Economics. His minimax theorem shows that in certain zero sum games there exists a strategy to minimize their maximum losses. He later extended the theorem to include games involving more than two players. Another important contribution made by von Neumann was to the problem of the existence of equilibrium in mathematical models of supply and demand. His solution employed the Browser’s ﬁxpoint theorem. Von Neumann became very interested in practical problems and was involved in several consultancies including the United States navy, IBM, the CIA and the Rand Corporation. He became an expert in the ﬁeld of explosions and discovered that large bombs are more devastating if they explode before touching the ground. This result was employed with devastating effect in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 at the altitude calculated by Von Neumann to inﬂict maximum damage. He contributed to the development of the Hydrogen bomb and to improved methods to utilize nuclear energy. Von Neumann and Ulam also developed computer simulations to assist in the development of the bomb. He gave his name to the von Neumann architecture used in almost all computers. However, credit should also be given to Eckhert and Mauchly who were working on this concept during their work on ENIAC. Virtually every computer is a von Neumann machine. He also created the ﬁeld of cellular automata. He is also credited as the inventor of the merge-sort algorithm (in which the ﬁrst and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged). He also invented the Monte Carlo method that allows complicated problems to be approximated through the use of random numbers. He was strongly anti-communist and worked on various military committees developing various scenarios of nuclear proliferation including intercontinental and submarine missiles.
