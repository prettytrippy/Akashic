giants. The IBM token-ring local area network was introduced in 1985. This enabled personal computer users to share printers, ﬁles and information within a building. It is essentially a computer network in which all of the computers are arranged in a circle (or ring). There is a special data frame termed a token, and the token moves from computer to the next computer until it arrives at a computer that needs to transmit data. This computer then converts the token frame into a data frame for transmission. That is, the computer that wishes to transmit catches the token, 4 Intel was founded by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore in 1968. 5 Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. 214 7 Famous Technology Companies attaches a message to it, and then sends it around the network. The Token Ring network later became the IEEE 802.5 standard. The Ethernet local area network was developed by Robert Metcalfe at Xerox and its performance was superiour to the IBM Token Ring network. Ethernet was ﬁrst published as a standard in 1980, and it was later published as the IEEE 802.2 standard. Metcalfe formed the technology company 3-Com to exploit the Ethernet technology. IBM introduced the Advanced Peer-To-Peer Networking architecture (APPN) in 1984. This was widely used for communication by mid-range systems and it allowed individual computers to talk to one another without a central server. IBM developed the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture. This technology boosts computer speed by using simpliﬁed machine instructions for fre- quently used functions. It reduces the time to execute commands and is the basis of most workstations in use today. Early work on RISC architecture goes back to work done by IBM in the mid-1960s. Later work by IBM led to the design of the RS/6000 and the subsequent development of the Power PC architecture. The RISC System/6000 was introduced in 1990. It is a family of workstations that were among the fastest and most powerful in the industry. IBM introduced the next generation of personal computers termed the Personal System/2 (PS/2) in 1987. It included a new operating system called Operating System/2 (OS/2). The latter gave users of personal computers access to multiple applications, very large programs and data, and allowed concurrent communication with other systems. It was the ﬁrst offering in IBM’s Systems Application Architecture (SAA) which was designed to make application programs look and work in the same manner across different systems such as personal computers, mid-range systems and larger systems. A research group at IBM developed a suite of Antivirus tools to protect personal computers from attacks from viruses. This led to the establishment of the High Integrity Computing Laboratory (HICL) at IBM. This laboratory went on to pioneer the science of computer viruses. IBM researchers introduced very fast computer memory chips in 1988. These chips could retrieve a single bit of information in 2×10−8 of a second. This was over four times faster than the existing generation of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. IBM also introduced the IBM Application System/400 (AS/400) in 1988. This was a new family of easy-to-use computers designed for small and intermediate-sized companies. It became one of the world’s most popular business computing systems. A team of IBM researchers succeeded in storing a billion bits of information (i.e., a gigabit) on a single square inch of disk space in 1989. This was 15–30 times greater than the existing data density on magnetic storage devices. The amount of data that a gigabit can store is equivalent to approximately 100,000 A4 pages. IBM introduced a laptop computer in 1991 to give customers computing capabilities on the road or in the air. IBM, Apple Computers and Motorola entered an agreement in 1991 to link Apple computers to IBM networks, and to develop a new reduced instruction set micro- processors for personal computers. IBM and Motorola completed development and fabrication of the PowerPC 620 microprocessor in 1994. The new open-systems 7.2 International Business Machines 215 environment allowed both IBM AIX and Macintosh software programs to run on RISC-based systems from both companies. The introduction of the personal computer represented a paradigm shift in com- puting, and it led to a fundamental change in the way in which people worked. It placed the power of the computer directly in the hands of millions of people. The previous paradigm was that an individual user had limited control over a computer, and the access privileges of the individual users were strictly controlled by the sys- tem administrators. The subsequent introduction of the client–server architecture led to the linking of the personal computers (clients) to larger computers (servers). These servers contained large amounts of data that could be shared with the individ- ual client computers.
