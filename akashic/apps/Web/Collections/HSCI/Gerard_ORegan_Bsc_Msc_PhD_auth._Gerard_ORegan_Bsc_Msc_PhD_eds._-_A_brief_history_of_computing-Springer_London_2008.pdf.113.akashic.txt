tinct from the “old economy” bricks and mortar companies. These new companies included the internet portal site “yahoo.com”, the on-line book store “amazon.com”, and the on-line auction site “ebay.com”. Yahoo.com provides news and a range of services, and it earns most of its revenue from advertisements. Amazon.com sells books as well as a collection of consumer and electronic goods. Ebay.com brings buyers and sellers together in an on-line auction space and allows users to bid for items. Boo.com was an on-line fashion company that failed dramatically in late 1999. Pets.com was an on-line pet supplies and accessory company that lasted one year in business. Priceline.com is an on-line travel ﬁrm that offers airlines and hotels a service to sell unﬁlled seats or rooms cheaply. ETrade.com is an on-line share dealing company. Some of these new technology companies were successful and remain in business. Others were ﬁnancial disasters due to poor business models, poor management and poor implementation of the new technology. Some of these technology companies offered a replacement or internet ver- sion of a traditional bricks and mortar company, whereas others offered a unique business offering. For example, the technology company “ebay.com” offers an auctioneering internet site to consumers worldwide. There was no available ser- vice like this available, and the service offering was quite distinct from traditional auctioneering. The internet portal company “yahoo.com” was founded by David Filo and Jerry Yang who were students at Stanford. It was initially a hobby for the two students, who used it as a way to keep track of their personal interests and their corresponding web sites on the internet. Their list of interests grew over time and became too long and unwieldy. Therefore, they broke their interests into a set of categories and then sub-categories, and this is the core concept of yahoo.com. The term “yahoo” may stand for “Yet another Hierarchical Ofﬁcious Oracle” or possibly it may have been taken from the name of the primitive creatures in Gulliver Travels by the Irish author Jonathon Swift. There was a lot of interest in the site from other students, family and friends and a growing community of users. The founders realized that the site had commercial potential, and they incorporated it as a business in 1995. The company launched its initial public offering (IPO) one year later in April 1996, and the company was valued at $850 million (or approximately 40 times its annual sales). The headquarters of the company are in California. Yahoo is a portal site and offers free email accounts to users, a search engine, news, shopping, entertainment, health, and so on. The company earns a lot of its revenue from advertisement (especially the click through advertisements that appear on a yahoo web page). Research indicates that only about 2% of users actually click through on these advertisements, and it is therefore questionable whether these advertisements are actually effective. The company also earns revenue from provid- ing services for businesses. These include web hosting services, web tools, larger 6.7 Dot Com Companies 191 mailboxes, personal advertisements for dating, and so on. The company has been very successful. Amazon is a famous internet company founded by Jeff Bezos in 1995. It was one of the earliest companies to sell products over the internet, and it commenced busi- ness as an on-line bookstore. Its product portfolio diversiﬁed over time to include the sale of CDs, DVDs, toys, computer software and video games. The name “Amazon” was chosen to represent the volume of products in the company’s catalogue, and it was therefore appropriate to name if after the world’s largest river. The initial focus of the company was to build up the “Amazon” brand throughout the world. Its goal was to become the world’s largest bookstore, and in order to build up market share it initially sold books at a loss by giving discounts to buyers. Its strategy in building the brand through advertisements, marketing and discounts worked very effectively, and the company is now well-established and recording healthy proﬁts. The company headquarters is in Seattle, Washington. The IPO of the company took place in 1997 and was highly successful. It has been one of the most successful internet companies, and it has become the largest on line bookstore in the world. Many products on the Amazon web site are reviewed to give the buyer an indication as to how good the product is. Amazon has all the essential characteristics for a successful internet company. It has a sound business model with a very large product catalogue; a well-designed web site with good searching facilities; good check out facilities and good order fulﬁllment. The company has also developed an associates model, and this allows the many associates of Amazon to receive a commission for purchases of products on Amazon made through the associate site. The associates maintain a link to Amazon from their web site, and when a purchaser
