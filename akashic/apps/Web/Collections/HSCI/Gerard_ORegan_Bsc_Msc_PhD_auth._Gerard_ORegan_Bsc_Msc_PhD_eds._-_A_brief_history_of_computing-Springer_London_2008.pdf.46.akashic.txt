mines the particular transformation of the message. The key is used to transform the chosen message into a cryptogram (i.e., the encrypted text). The cryptogram is then transmitted over a channel to the receiver who uses the key to apply the inverse transformation to decipher the cryptogram into the original message. The enciphering of a message is a functional operation. Suppose M is a message, K the key and E is the encrypted message then: E = f (M, K) This is more often written as a function of one variable E = Ti M where the index i corresponds to the particular key being used. It is assumed that there are a ﬁnite number of keys K1, ...Km and a corresponding set of transformations T1,T2, ...,Tm. Each key has a probability pi of being chosen as the key. The encryption of a mes- sage M with key Ki is therefore given by: E = Ti M Following the receipt of the encrypted message at the receiving end it is possible to retrieve the original message by: M = T −1 i E The channel that the encrypted text is sent may be intercepted by an enemy who will try techniques to break the encrypted text. The enemy will examine the cryptogram and attempt to guess the key and the message from the cryptogram. 2.7 Von Neumann John von Neumann (Fig. 2.23) was a Hungarian mathematician who made fun- damental contributions to mathematics, set theory, computer science, economics, quantum analysis and many more. He was born into a non-practicing Jewish family in Budapest, Humgary in 1903. His father was a lawyer in a bank and the family 2.7 Von Neumann 63 Fig. 2.23 John von Neumann, Los Alamos Courtesy United States Government Archives. was well-connected. J´anos (John) von Neumann was a child prodigy and displayed an extra-ordinary talent for mathematics at an early age. This included the ability to divide two 8-digit numbers at the age of six. By the age of twelve he was at the graduate level in mathematics. He attended the Lutheran Gymnasium which was one of the top schools in Hungary. He received his PhD in Mathematics from the University of Budapest in 1926 and was awarded a diploma in chemical engineering from the Technical University of Zurich in the same year. His PhD degree was concerned with the axiomatiza- tion of set theory. Dedekind and Peano had axiomatized arithmetic in the late nine- teenth century and and Hilbert had axiomatized geometry. However, set theory as developed by Cantor and formalized by Frege was dealt a major blow by Russell’s paradox. Russell’s paradox was discovered by Bertand Russell in 1901 and he com- municated the paradox to Frege in 1902. Russell had posed the question whether the set S of all sets that do not contain themselves as members contains itself as a member: i.e., does S ∈S? In either case, a contradiction arises since if S ∈S then as S is a set that does not contain itself as a member: i.e., S /∈S. Similarly, if S /∈S then S is a set that does not contain itself as a member and therefore S ∈S. Russell’s paradox created a crisis in the foundations of set theory (and in the foundations of mathematics) in the early twentieth century. Hilbert and the formalists dealt with Russell’s paradox by insisting on the use of ﬁnite, well-deﬁned and constructible objects. Further, they insisted on rules of inference that were absolutely certain. The axiomatization of set theory by Zer- melo and Frankel in 1908 showed how the contradictions in set theory could be 64 2 Foundations resolved by restricting set comprehension. The axiomatization employed prevents the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. It allows the construction of all sets that are used in mathematics. However, their axiomatization did not exclude the possibility of the existence of sets which belong to themselves. Russell resolved the paradox in his Principles of Mathematics by developing the “Theory of Types” which avoids self-reference. Russell argued that the set S (the set of all sets that are not members of themselves) can be avoided if all propositional sentences are arranged into a hierarchy. The lowest level of the hierarchy consists of sentences about individuals; the next level consists of sentences about sets of individuals; the next level is sets of sets of individuals, and so on. The level is essentially the type of the object. It is then possible to refer to all objects for which a given predicate holds only if they are all of the same “type”. It is required to specify the objects that a predicate function will apply to before deﬁning the predicate. For example, before the predicate prime number is deﬁned it is ﬁrst required to specify
