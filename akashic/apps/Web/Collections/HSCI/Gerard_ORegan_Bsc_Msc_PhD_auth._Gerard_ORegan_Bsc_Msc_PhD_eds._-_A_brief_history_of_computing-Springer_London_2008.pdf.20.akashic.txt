the Babylonians about 1000 years before Pythagoras. The Pythagorean society was dealt a major blow13 by the discovery of the incommensurability of the square root of 2: i.e., there are no numbers p, q such that √2 = p/q. This dealt a major blow to their philosophy that number is the nature of being. Thales was a sixth century (BC) philosopher from Miletus in Asia Minor who made contributions to philosophy, geometry and astronomy. His contributions to philosophy are mainly in the area of metaphysics, and he was concerned with questions on the nature of the world. His objective was to give a natural or scientiﬁc explanation of the cosmos, rather than relying on the traditional supernatural explanation of creation in Greek mythology. He believed that there was single substance that was the underlying constituent of the world, and he believed that this substance was water. It can only be speculated why he believed water to be the underlying substance but some reasons may be that water is essential to life; when a solid is compressed it is generally transformed to a liquid substance, and so on. Thales also contributed to mathematics [AnL:95] and there is a well-known theorem in Euclidean geometry named after him. It states that if A, B and C are points on a circle, and where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle <ABC is a right angle. 13 The Pythagoreans were a secret society and its members took a vow of silence with respect to this discovery. However, one member of the society is said to have shared the secret result with others outside the sect, and the apocryphal account is that he was thrown into a lake for his betrayal and drowned. They obviously took Mathematics seriously back then. 1.4 The Greeks 11 Euclid lived in Alexandria during the early Hellenistic period. He is considered the father of geometry in that he set out a systematic treatment of geometry starting from 5 axioms, 5 postulates and 23 deﬁnitions to derive and prove a comprehensive set of theorems. He is therefore the father of the axiomatic method for mathemat- ics. His systematic account was published in the thirteen books of the Elements [Hea:56], and this has been used as a mathematics textbook for over 2000 years. It includes the treatment of geometry and number theory. His method of proof was generally constructive in that as well as demonstrating the truth of a theorem the proof would often include the construction of the required entity. However, he was also familiar with indirect proof as the argument to show that there are an inﬁnite number of primes demonstrates: 1. Suppose there is a ﬁnite number of primes (say n primes). 2. Multiply all n primes together and add 1 to form N. i. (N = p1 ∗p2 ∗. . . .∗pn + 1) 3. N is not divisible by p1, p2, . . . .., pn as dividing by any of these gives a remainder of one. 4. Therefore, N must either be prime or divisible by some other prime that was not included in the list. 5. Therefore, there must be at least n + 1 primes. 6. This is a contradiction as it was assumed that there was a ﬁnite number of primes n. 7. Therefore, the assumption that there is a ﬁnite number of primes is false. 8. Therefore, there is an inﬁnite number of primes. Euclidean geometry included the parallel postulate or Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate. This postulate generated interest as many mathematicians believed that it was unneces- sary and could be proved as a theorem by using the other axioms and postulates. It states that: Deﬁnition 1.1 (Parallel Postulate) If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, if extended indeﬁnitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles. This postulate was later proved to be independent of the other postulates. In the nineteenth century other geometries were developed that rejected the ﬁfth postu- late as formulated by Euclid. These include the hyperbolic geometry discovered independently by Bolyai and Lobachevsky, and elliptic geometry as developed by Riemann. The standard model of Riemannian geometry is the sphere where lines are great circles. Non-Euclidean geometries became important in the early twentieth century with the work done by Albert Einstein in the Theory of Relativity. Euclid and contemporary Hellenistic mathematicians aimed to provide construc-
