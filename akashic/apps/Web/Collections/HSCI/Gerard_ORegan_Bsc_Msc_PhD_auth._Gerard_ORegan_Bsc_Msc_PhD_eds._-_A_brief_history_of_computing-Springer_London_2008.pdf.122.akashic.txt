It used a 36-bit word and had an address-space of 32,768 words. It was used by the US Air Force to provide an early warning system for missiles and also by NASA to control space ﬂights. It cost approximately $3 million but it could be rented for over $60 K per month. IBM introduced the ﬁrst computer disk storage system in 1957. This medium was called the Random Access Method of Accounting and Control (RAMAC), and it became the basic storage medium for transaction processing. The RAMAC’s ran- dom access arm could retrieve data stored on any of the 50 spinning disks. IBM contributed to the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) early warning system during the cold war. The US Air Force had commenced work on SAGE in 1954, and IBM provided the hardware for the system. The initial instal- lation was completed in 1958, and the system was fully implemented in 1963. It remained operational until 1984. There were 24 SAGE Direction Centers and three SAGE Combat Centers located in the US. Each centre was linked by long-distance telephone lines, and Burroughs provided the communications equipment that allowed the centers to communicate 210 7 Famous Technology Companies with one another. This was one of the earliest computer networks. Each center con- tained a large digital computer that automated the information ﬂow, and provided real time control information on aircraft and on weapons systems. It tracked and identiﬁed aircraft, and presented the electronic information to operators on a display device (cathode ray tub). The IBM 1401 data processing system and the IBM 1403 printer were launched in 1959. The 1401 was an all-transitorised data processing system and it was aimed at small businesses. It included high speed card punching and reading, magnetic tape input and output and high speed printing. The 1403 printer was four times faster than any competitor printer. IBM introduced a program termed “Speak Up” to enhance staff communication in 1959. It opened the headquarters for its research division at York town Heights, New York in 1961. 7.2.3 The IBM System 360 Thomas Watson announced the new System 360 to the world at a press conference in 1964 and said: The System/360 represents a sharp departure from concepts of the past in design- ing and building computers. It is the product of an international effort in IBM’s laboratories and plants and is the ﬁrst time IBM has redesigned the basic internal architecture of its computers in a decade. The result will be more computer produc- tivity at lower cost than ever before. This is the beginning of a new generation – not only of computers – but of their application in business, science and government. The chief architect for the 360 was Gene Amhadl and the S360 project manager was Fred Brooks.2 The IBM 360 was a family of small to large computers, and it offered a choice of ﬁve processors and 19 combinations of power, speed and memory (Fig. 7.6). There were 14 models in the family. The concept of a “family of computers” was a paradigm shift away from the traditional “one size ﬁts all” philosophy of the com- puter industry, as up until then, every computer model was designed independently. The family of computers ranged from minicomputers with 24 KB of memory, to supercomputers for US missile defence systems. However, all these computers had the same user instruction set, and the main difference was that the larger computers implemented the more complex machine instructions with hardware, whereas the smaller machines used microcode. The S/360 Architecture potentially allowed customers to commence with a lower cost computer model, and to then upgrade over time to a larger system to meet their evolving needs. The fact that the same instruction set was employed meant that the time and expense of re-writing software was avoided. The machines had 2 Fred Brooks is the author of “The Mythical Man Month”.

The System 360 also gave signiﬁcant performance gains, as it included IBM-designed solid logic technology. This allows
