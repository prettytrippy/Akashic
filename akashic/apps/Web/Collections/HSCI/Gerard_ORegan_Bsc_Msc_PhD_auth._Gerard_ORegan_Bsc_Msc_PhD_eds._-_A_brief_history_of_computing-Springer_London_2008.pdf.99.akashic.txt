to Hume’s theory of empiricism. Kant argued that there is a third force in human knowledge that provides concepts that can’t be inferred from experience. Such con- cepts include the laws of logic (e.g., modus ponens), causality, and so on, and Kant argued that the third force was the manner in which the human mind structures its experiences. These structures (or systematic rules by which the mind structures its experience) are called categories, and include entities such as modus ponens. 17 Hume argues that these principles apply to subjects such as Theology as its foundations are in faith and divine revelation which are neither matters of fact nor relations of ideas. 18 “When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experi- mental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the ﬂames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion”. 164 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems The continental school of philosophy included thinkers such as Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty who argued that the world and the human body are mutually inter- twined. Heidegger emphasized that existence can only be considered with respect to a changing world. Merleau-Ponty emphasized embodiment: i.e., that human cog- nition relies heavily on the body, and he identiﬁed the concept of a body-subject that actively participates both as the perceiver of knowledge and as an object of perception. The analytic school of philosophy was an attempt in the early twentieth century to clean up philosophy. The school believed that many of the philosophical prob- lems were due to inadequate scientiﬁc knowledge and an abuse of language. The school was founded in Vienna after the ﬁrst-world war, and it was known as the Vienna circle. They developed what became known as logical empiricism and this employed the veriﬁcation principle. This principle stated that a proposition could have meaning if and only if it could be veriﬁed. This principle was later shown to be ﬂawed and logical empiricism failed. Wittgenstein was living in Vienna at the time, and although he was not a member of the circle, he had done important work in his Tractatus Logico Philosophicus [Wit:22] to produce a full deconstruction of language into atomic propositions. These atomic propositions refer to simple objects in the world, which could then be combined to form more complex objects. Philosophy has been studied for over two millennia but to date very little progress has been made in solving the fundamental philosophical questions. Artiﬁcial Intel- ligence will need to take a practical approach to dealing with the key philosophical questions. 5.5 Cognitive Psychology Psychology arose out of the ﬁeld of psychophysics in the late nineteenth century in which various German pioneers attempted to quantify perception and sensation. In fact, one of these pioneers, Fechner, produced a mathematical formulation of the relationship between stimulus and sensation: S = k log I + c The symbol S refers to the intensity of the sensation, the symbols k and c are con- stants, and the symbol I refers to the physical intensity of the stimulus. Psychology was deﬁned by William James as the science of mental life. One of the early behaviouralist psychologist’s was Pavlov who showed that it was possible to develop a conditional reﬂex in a dog. His experiment showed that it was possible to make a dog salivate in response to the ringing of a bell. He did this by ringing a bell each time before meat was provided to the dog, and the dog therefore associated the presentation of meat with the ringing of the bell after a training period. Skinner developed the concept of conditioning further using rewards to reinforce desired behaviour, and punishment to discourage undesired behaviour. The 5.5 Cognitive Psychology 165 reinforcement of desired behaviour helps to motivate the individual to behave in a desired way, with punishment used to deter the individual from perform- ing undesired behaviour. The behavioural theory of psychology explains many behavioural aspects of the world, although it does not really explain aspects of complex learning such as language development. Further, behaviouralism does not take human experience into account, and experience plays an important role in explaining human behaviour. Merleau-Ponty19 considered the problem of what the structure of the human mind must be in order to allow the objects of the external world to exist in our minds in the form that they do. He argued for phenomenology as originally developed by Hegel and Husserl. This involves a focus and exploration of phenomena with the goal of establishing the essential features of experience. Merleau-Ponty developed the
