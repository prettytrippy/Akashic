Rhind Papyrus is one of the most famous Egyptian papyri on mathematics, and it is essentially a mathematical text book. The Greeks made a major contribution to mathematics and geometry, and most students are familiar with the work of Euclid on geometry. Chapter two considers inﬂuential ﬁgures in the history of computing who did important foundational work. It includes a discussion on Boole, Babbage, Turing, Shannon, and von Neumann. Boolean logic is fundamental to the working of all modern computers, and Boole is considered to be one of the fathers of comput- ing. Babbage did pioneering work on the Difference Engine as well as designing the Analytic Engine. The difference engine was essentially a mechanical calculator while the analytic engine was essentially the world’s ﬁrst computer. However, the analytic engine was never built. Lady Ada Lovelace who was a friend of Babbage’s designed the ﬁrst programs to run on the analytic engine, and she believed that the machine would be applicable to many disciplines. Claude Shannon showed how Boolean Logic could be applied to simplify the design of circuits, and how Boolean logic could be employed in computing. Tur- ing’s work on computability showed that whatever was computable was computable by his theoretical Turing Machine, and he also made contributions to the Artiﬁcial Intelligence ﬁeld. Von Neumann and others deﬁned the von Neumann architecture which is the fundamental architecture used in modern computers. Chapter three considers various programming languages developed over the last ﬁfty years. These include the ﬁve generations of programming languages such as machine code languages that use actual machine instructions, to assembly lan- guages, to high-level programming languages such as Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, C, C++ and Java. The earliest high-level language developed was called Plankalk¨ul, and this language was developed by the German engineer Zuse. Functional program- Preface ix ming languages are discussed as well as the important area of syntax and semantics of programming languages. Chapter four considers the important ﬁeld of software engineering. It discusses the birth of software engineering at the NATO conference at Garmisch in 1968. This conference discussed the crisis with software and included problems with projects being delivered late or with poor quality. The software engineering ﬁeld is con- cerned with sound techniques to engineer high quality software to meet customers’ requirements. It includes methodologies to deﬁne requirements, design, develop- ment and test software as well as the management of change. Mathematical tech- niques that may assist in software engineering are also considered, and these include approaches such as Z and VDM. The Capability Maturity Model Integration model is discussed, as this offers a useful framework to enhance the software engineering capability of a company. Chapter ﬁve considers Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems. Artiﬁcial Intel- ligence is a multi-disciplinary ﬁeld that is concerned with the problem of producing intelligence in machines. This chapter considers some of the key disciplines in the ﬁeld including philosophy, psychology, linguistics, neural networks, and so on. The Turing Test was proposed by Alan Turing to judge whether a machine is intelligent. Searles’s Chinese room argument is a rebuttal and argues that even if a machine passes the Turing Test it still may not be considered intelligent. Chapter six is concerned with the Internet revolution and considers the early work done by DARPA on the internet, and the subsequent invention of the world-wide web by Tim Berners-Leee at CERN in the early 1990. The rise of new technology companies such as Amazon is considered, as well as the frenzy that became the dot com bubble and subsequent dot com collapse. Many of these new technology companies had deeply ﬂawed business models which was a signiﬁcant factor in their eventual collapse. Several of dot com failures are considered including the on-line fashion company Boo.com and also the on-line pet food company Pets.com. Chapter seven is concerned with the achievements of several of the better known software technology companies. These include IBM, Motorola and Microsoft. Audience This book is suitable for students of Computer Science and for the general reader who is interested in the history of computing. Some of the material is technical and mathematical. However, any technical material is presented as simply as possible.
