Artiﬁcial neural networks aims to simulate various properties of biological neural networks. These are computers whose architecture is modeled on the brain. They consist of many hundreds of simple processing units which are wired together in a complex communication network. Each unit or node is a simpliﬁed model of a real neuron which ﬁres if it receives a sufﬁciently strong input signal from the other nodes to which it is connected. The strength of these connections may be varied in order for the network to perform different tasks corresponding to different patterns of node ﬁring activity. The objective is to solve a particular problem, and artiﬁcial neural networks have been successfully applied to speech recognition problems and image analysis. An expert system is a computer system that allows knowledge to be stored and intelligently retrieved. It is a program that is made up of a set of rules (or knowl- edge). These rules are generally supplied by the subject-matter experts about a spe- ciﬁc class of problems. The expert system also provides a problem solving compo- nent that allows analysis of the problem to take place, as well as recommending an appropiate course of action to solve the problem. Expert Systems have been a major success story in the AI ﬁeld. Chapter 6 The Internet Revolution Key Topics ARPANET TCP/IP The Internet The World-Wide Web Dot Com Bubble E-Software Development 6.1 Introduction The origins of what has developed to become the internet and world wide web goes back to work done in the early 1940s by Vanevar Bush (Fig. 6.1). Bush was an American scientist who had done work on submarine detection for the United States Navy, He later did work with others did work on an automated network analyser to solve differential equations at MIT. He became director of the ofﬁce of Scientiﬁc Research and Development which was concerned with weapons research and development. This organisation employed several thousand scientists, and was responsible for supervising the development of the atomic bomb. Bush developed a close win-win relationship between the United States mili- tary and universities. He arranged large research funding for universities to carry out research related to the needs of the United States military. This allowed the military to beneﬁt from the early exploitation of research results, and it also led to better facilities and laboratories in universities to carry out research. Bush ini- tially developed close links with universities such as Harvard and Berkeley. This was the foundation for future cooperation between the universities and the United States Department of Defence, and it would lead eventually to the development of ARPANET by DARPA. 179 180 6 The Internet Revolution Fig. 6.1 Vanevar Bush Bush’s inﬂuence on the development of the internet is due to his visionary description of an information management system that he called the “memex”. The memex (memory extender) is described in his famous essay “As We May Think” which was published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1945 [Bus:45]. Bush envisaged the memex as a device electronically linked to a library and able to display books and ﬁlms. Bush’s article essentially describes a theoretical proto-hypertext computer sys- tem, and this inﬂuenced the subsequent development of hypertext systems. The description of a memex is described in [Bus:45]: Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private ﬁle and library. It needs a name, and to coin one at random, “memex” will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and ﬂexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk. Bush predicted that: Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there ampliﬁed.. 6.2 The ARPANET 181 This description motivated Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart to independently formulate the various ideas that would became hypertext. Tim Berners-Lee would later use hypertext as part of the development of the world-wide web. 6.2 The ARPANET There were approximately 10,000 computers in the world in the 1960s. These computers were very expensive ($100K–$200K) and had very primitive processing power. They contained only a few thousand words of magnetic memory, and pro-
