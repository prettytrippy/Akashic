distribution curve, and this curve is important in probability theory. It is also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve. The curve has two parameters, and these are the mean (a measure of location or centre of the curve), and the standard deviation (a measure of variability from the mean). The mean is represented by the Greek letter  (mu) and the standard deviation is represented by the Greek letter  (sigma). The properties of the standard deviation is given in Table 7.1. Walter Shewhart was one of the grandfathers of quality and he worked on quality improvements by reducing product variation in the 1920s. He demonstrated that Table 7.1 Properties of sigma levels -Level Area of Curve within Sigma Level 1-sigma 68.27% 2-sigma 95.45% 3-sigma 99.73% 4-sigma 99.993% 5-sigma 99.99994% 6-sigma 99.9999998% 7.4 Motorola 223 three sigma (or standard deviations) from the mean is the point where a process requires correction. The term “Six Sigma” was coined by a Motorola engineer called Bill Smith in the early 1980s, and it was used by Motorola both as a measure of process variability and as a methodology (Table 7.2) for performance and quality improvement. The application of the methodology by an organization leads to a change of culture in the organization. Motorola engineers realized that the traditional quality levels of measuring defects in thousands of opportunities did not provide sufﬁcient granularity for qual- ity and performance improvements. The new Motorola standard allowed defects per million opportunities to be measured. Six-Sigma was a major success for Motorola, and the company made major savings following its introduction in the mid-1980s. The objective of the 6 programme was to improve the quality performance of all key operations in the business including manufacturing, service, marketing and support. The goal was to design and manufacture products that are 99.9997% perfect: i.e., 3.4 defects per million opportunities. The fundamental philosophy of the methodology is that every area of the organization can be improved. The steps involved in 6-sigma are summarized by the acronym DMAIC.9 This stands for Deﬁne, Measure Analyse, Improve and Control. There is a step zero before you start and it is concerned with six-sigma leadership. The methodology is based upon improving processes by understanding and con- trolling variation. This leads to more predictable processes with enhanced capability, and therefore more consistent results. The participants on a six-sigma programme have an associated belt (e.g., green belt, black bet, etc.) to indicate their experience and expertise with the methodol- ogy. A Black Belt has received extensive training on six sigma and statistical tech- niques. Motorola was awarded the ﬁrst Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in recognition of its efforts in 6. This Award was established by the US Congress to recognize the pursuit of quality in American business. The use of six-sigma is not a silver bullet to success for any organization. Motorola paid the price for totally misjudging the transition from the analog cellular market to digital cellular. Table 7.2 Six sigma methodology Activity Description Deﬁne Deﬁne the process. Measure Measure the current performance of the process. Analyse Analyse the process to identify waste. Improve Improve the process. Control Measure the improvements made to the process and repeat the cycle. 9 DMAIC was inﬂuenced by Demings “Plan, Do, Act, Check” cycle. 224 7 Famous Technology Companies 7.4.3 Cellular Technologies The invention of the telephone by Graham Bell in the late nineteenth century was a revolution in human communication, as it allowed people to communicate over dis- tance. However, its key restriction was that the physical location of the person to be contacted was required before communication could take place: i.e., communication was between places rather than people. Bell Laboratories introduced the idea of cellular communications in 1947 with the police car technology. Motorola was the ﬁrst company to incorporate the tech- nology into a portable device that was designed for use outside of an automobile. The inventor of the ﬁrst modern portable handset was Martin Cooper of Motorola, and he made the ﬁrst call on a portable cell phone in April 1973 to the head of research at Bell Labs. It took a further 10 years for Motorola to bring the mobile phone to the market, and it introduced the ﬁrst portable mobile phone in 1983. It was called DynaTAC, and it cost $3,500 and weighed one pound. Today, there are more mobile phone users than ﬁxed line users, and mobile phones weigh as little as 3 ounces. Bell Laboratories developed the Advance Mobile Phone Services (AMPS) stan-
