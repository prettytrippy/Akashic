by the recitation of special incantations in Hebrew. However, as the golem grew bigger he became violent and started killing people in Prague. The Rabbi agreed to destroy the golem if the anti-semitic violence against the Jews of Prague stopped. The golem was destroyed by erasing the ﬁrst letter of the word “emet” from the golem’s forehead to make the Hebrew word “met”, meaning death. The remains of Prague’s golem are believed to be in Prague. Golems were not very bright as they were created by man and not God. Whenever, a golem was commanded to perform a task, it did so by following the instructions literally. The golem has similarities with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Frankstein’s mon- ster is created by an overambitious scientist who is punished for his blasphemy of creation (in that creation is for God alone). The monster feels rejected following creation, and inﬂicts a horrible revenge on its creator. The story of the golum was given a more modern version in the Czech play “Rossums Universal Robots”. This science ﬁction play by Capek appeared in Prague in 1921. It was translated into English and appeared in London in 1923. It contains the ﬁrst reference to the term “robot”, and the play considers the exploitation of artiﬁcial workers in a factory. The robots (or androids) are initially happy to serve humans, but become unhappy with their existence over a period of time. The fundamental question that the play is considering is whether the robots are being exploited, and if so, is this ethical, and how should the robots respond to their exploitation. It eventually leads to a revolt by the robots and the extermination of the human race. Capek considered the exploitation of non-human forms of life (the newts) in his play “War with the Newts” which was a satire on Europe and the world in the 1930s. 5.2 Descartes Rene Descartes (Fig. 5.1) was an inﬂuential French mathematician, scientist and philosopher. He was born in a village in the Loire valley in France in 1596, and studied law at the University of Poitiers. He never practiced as a lawyer and instead served Prince Maurice of Nassau in the Netherlands. He invented the Cartesian coordinate system that is used in plane geometry and algebra. In this system, each 152 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems Fig. 5.1 Rene Descartes point on the plane is identiﬁed through two numbers: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. Descartes made important contributions to philosophy and he attempted to develop a fundamental set of principles which can be known to be true. He employed scepticism to arrive at this core set of truths, and his approach was to renounce any idea that could be doubted. He rejected the senses since the senses can deceive, and therefore they are not a sound source of knowledge. For example, during a dream the subject perceives stimuli that appear to be real, but these have no existence out- side the subject’s mind. Therefore, it is inappropriate to rely on one’s senses as the foundation of knowledge. He argued that a powerful “evil demon or mad-scientist” could exist who sets out to manipulate and deceive subjects, thereby preventing them from knowing the true nature of reality. The evil demon could bring the subject into existence including an implanted memory. The question is how can one know for certain what is true given the limitations of the senses. From this, Descartes deduced that there was one single principle that must be true. He argued that even if the is being deceived, then clearly he is thinking and must exist. This principle of existence or being is more famously known as “cogito, ergo sum” (I think, therefore I am). Descartes argued that this existence can be applied to the present only, as memory may be manipulated and therefore doubted. Further, the only existence that he sure of is that he is a “thinking thing”. He cannot be sure of the existence of his body as his body is perceived by his senses which he has proven to be unreliable. Therefore, his mind or thinking thing is the only thing 5.2 Descartes 153 about him that cannot be doubted. His mind is used to make judgments, and to deal with un-reliable perceptions received via the senses. Descartes constructed a system of knowledge from this one principle using the deductive method. He deduced the existence of a benevolent God using the onto- logical argument. This argument had ﬁrst been formulated by St. Anselm in the eleventh century, and the proof of God was based on the deﬁnition and perfection of God (“The Being that nothing greater can be conceived”).
