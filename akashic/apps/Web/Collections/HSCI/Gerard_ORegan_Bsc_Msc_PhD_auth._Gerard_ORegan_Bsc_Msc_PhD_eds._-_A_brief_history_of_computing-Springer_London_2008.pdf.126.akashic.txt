later become the world’s most popular word processing package. Microsoft released its ﬁrst version of Microsoft Windows in 1985, and this product was originally a graphical extension for its MS-DOS operating system. However, later that year, Microsoft and IBM commenced work on a new operating system called Operating System 2 (OS/2). This operating system was for the new IBM PS/2 personal com- puter. Microsoft introduced its integrated ofﬁce products called Microsoft Works in 1987, and this product suite Included a word processor, spreadsheet, database and other ofﬁce applications. The company introduced its well-known Microsoft Ofﬁce product in 1989, and this includes Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Powerpoint. Microsoft intro- duced Windows 3.0 in 1990, and this new operating system included graphical user interfaces. The company discontinued its work on OS/2, and focused instead 218 7 Famous Technology Companies on improving Microsoft Windows. Windows (and its successors) became the most popular operating systems in the coming years. Microsoft’s ofﬁce suite gradually became the dominant ofﬁce suite with a far greater market share than its competitors such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoft released its Windows 3.1 operating system and its Access database software in 1992. Windows was the most widely used GUI operating system by 1993. Windows 95 was released in 1995, Windows NT in 1996, Windows 2000 in 2000, and Windows XP in 2001. 7.3.1 Microsoft Windows and Apple GUI Apple Computers had taken a copyright infringement lawsuit against Microsoft in 1988, and the legal arguments lasted 5 years. The ﬁnal ruling in 1993 was in favour of Microsoft. Apple had sought to prevent Microsoft from using GUI elements that were similar to those in Apple’s operating system. However, Apple lost the lawsuit and the subsequent appeal. It had claimed that the look and feel of the Macintosh operating system was protected by copyright including 189 GUI elements. However, the judge found that 179 of these had already been licensed to Microsoft (as part of the Windows 1.0 agreement), and that most of the 10 other GUI elements were not copyrightable. The Apple Computer vs. Microsoft case generated a lot of interest in the com- puter science community. Some observers considered Apple to be the villain, as they were using legal means to dominate the GUI market and restrict the use of an idea that was of beneﬁt to the wider community. Others considered Microsoft to be the villain with their theft of Apple’s work, and their argument was that if Microsoft succeeded a precedent would be set in allowing larger companies to steal the core concepts of any software developer’s work. The court’s judgment seemed to invalidate the copyrighting of the “look and feel” of an application. However, the judgement was based more on contract law rather than copyright law, as Microsoft and Apple had previously entered into a contract with respect to licensing of Apple’s icons on Windows 1.0. Further, Apple had not acquired a software patent to protect the intellectual idea of the look and feel of its Macintosh operating system. Further, had Apple won then the development of X-Windows and other open-source GUIs would have been impeded. 7.3.2 The Browser Wars The world wide web was invented by Tim Bernards Lee in the early 1990s. Microsoft was initially slow to respond to the rise of the internet. However, in the mid-1990s it expanded its product suite into the world wide web with Microsoft Network (MSN). This product was intended to compete directly against America On-Line (AOL). The company developed some key internet technologies such as ActiveX, VBScript and JScript. ActiveX is an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM), and VBScript and Jscript 7.4 Motorola 219 are script languages. The company also released a new version of Microsoft SQL Server that provided built-in support for internet applications. The company released a new version of Microsoft Ofﬁce and Internet Explorer 4.0 (its internet browser) in 1997. This was the beginning of Microsoft dominance of the browser market. Netscape had dominated the market but as Internet Explorer 4.0 (and its successors) was provided as a standard part of the Windows operating system (and also on Apple computers) it led to the replacement of Netscape by Internet Explorer. This led to a ﬁling against Microsoft stating that Microsoft was engaged in anti- competitive practices by including the Internet Explore browser in the Windows operating system, and that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994. The court was asked to stop the anti-competitive practices of the company. The leaking of internal memos of the company on the internet caused a great deal of controversy
