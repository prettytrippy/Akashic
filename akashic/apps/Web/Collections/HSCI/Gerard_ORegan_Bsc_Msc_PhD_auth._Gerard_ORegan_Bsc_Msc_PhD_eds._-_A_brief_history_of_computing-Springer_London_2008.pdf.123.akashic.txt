denser and faster circuits than earlier transistors, and was over 1,000 times more reliable than vacuum tubes. The S/360 was used extensively in the Apollo project to place man on the moon. The contribution by IBM computers and personnel were essential to the success of the project. IBM invested over $5 billion in the design and development of the S/360. However, the gamble paid off and it was a very successful product line. The System/360 introduced a number of new industry standards including: r 8-bit Bytes r Byte Addressable Memory r 32-bit words r Two’s complement Arithmetic r EBCDIC Character Set r Microcoded CPUs r IBM Floating Point Architecture. IBM introduced the Customer Information Control System (CICS) in 1969. This is a transaction processing system designed for online and batch processing. It was originally developed at IBM’s Palo Alto laboratory, but development moved to IBM’s laboratory at Hursley, England from the mid-1970s. It is still developed and enhanced at Hursley. It is used by banks and insurance companies in the ﬁnancial sector for their core business functions. It can support several thousand transactions per second, and up to 300 billion transactions ﬂow through CICS every day. It is available on large 212 7 Famous Technology Companies mainframes and on several operating systems, including Z/OS, AIX, Windows and Linux. CICS applications have been written in Cobol, PL/1, C and Java. The IBM System/370 was introduced in 1970. It was backwards compatible with the older 360 system, in that programs that ran on the 360 could still run on the 370. This made it easier for customers to upgrade from their System 360 to the System 370. The S/370 employed Virtual Memory.3 The ﬂoppy disk was introduced in 1971, and it became the standard for storing personal computer data. The IBM 3340 Winchester disk drive was introduced in 1973. It doubled the information density on disk surfaces and included a small light read/write head that was designed to ride on an air ﬁlm that was 18 × 10−6 inches thick. Winchester technology was employed up to the early 1990s. IBM introduced the Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking protocol in 1974, and this protocol provided a set of rules and procedures for communication between computers. It remained an important standard until the open architecture standards appeared in the 1990s. It introduced the IBM 5100 Portable Computer in 1975 which cost under $20,000. This was a desktop machine and was used by engineers and scientists. IBM’s Federal Systems Division built the ﬂight computers and special hardware for the space-shuttle program. IBM developed the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in the mid-1970s. DES pro- vides a high degree of security during the transmission of data over communication channels. It speciﬁes an algorithm that enciphers and deciphers a message. The effect of enciphering is to make the message meaningless to unauthorized discovery as the task of breaking the encryption algorithm is extremely difﬁcult. 7.2.4 The IBM Personal Computer IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer (or PC) in 1981 and this machine was intended to be used by small businesses and in the home (Fig. 7.7). Its price was $1,565 and it was the lowest price computer produced up to that date. It offered 16 kilobytes of memory (that was expandable to 256 kilobytes), a ﬂoppy disk and a monitor. The IBM Personal Computer became an immediate success and became the industry standard. The personal computer also led to a new industry of “IBM-compatible” computers. These compatible computers had all of the essential features of the IBM PC but were typically retailed for a much lower price. IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer XT in 1983. This model had more memory, a dual-sided diskette drive and a high-performance ﬁxed-disk drive. The Personal Computer/AT was introduced by IBM in 1984. 3 Virtual Memory was developed for the Atlas Computer at Manchester University in England in the early 1960s. It allowed the actual memory space of a computer to appear much larger by using the space available on the hard drive. The Atlas computer was a joint venture between the Manchester University, Ferranti and Plessey. 7.2 International Business Machines 213 Fig. 7.7 IBM Personal Computer Courtesy of IBM archives. IBM had traditionally produced all of the components for its machines. However, it outsourced the production of components to other companies for the IBM PC. The production of the processor chip was outsourced to a company called Intel,4 and the development of the Disk Operating System (DOS) was outsourced to a small company called Microsoft.5 These two companies would later become technology
