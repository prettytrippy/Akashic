computers had the ability to perform intelligent operations. Simon’s and Newell’s LT program was demonstrated at the Dartmouth summer conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence. This program was very inﬂuential as it demonstrated that knowledge and information could be programmed into a computer, and that a computer had the ability to solve theorems in mathematics. John McCarthy’s approach to knowledge representation is to employ logic as the method of representing information in computer memory. He proposed a program called the Advice Taker in his inﬂuential paper “Programs with Common Sense” [Mc:59]. The idea was that this program would be able to draw conclusions from a set of premises, and McCarthy states that a program has common sense if it is capable of automatically deducing for itself “a sufﬁciently wide class of immediate consequences of anything it is told and what it already knows”. The Advice Taker aims to use logic to represent knowledge (i.e., premises that are taken to be true), and it then applies the deductive method to deduce further truths from the relevant premises.6 That is, the program manipulates the formal language (e.g., predicate logic), and provides a conclusion that may be a statement or an imperative. McCarthy’s Advice Taker differs from Simon’s and Newell’s LT program in that the latter program is a heuristic for deduction. McCarthy envisaged that the Advice Taker would be a program that would be able to learn and improve. This would be done by making statements to the program, and telling it about its symbolic environment. The program will have available to it all the logical con- sequences of what it has already been told and previous knowledge. McCarthy’s desire was to create programs to learn from their experience as effectively as humans do. McCarthy’s philosophy is that common sense knowledge and reasoning can be formalised with logic. A particular system is described by a set of sentences in logic. These logic sentences represent all that is known about the world in general, and what is known about the particular situation and the goals of the systems. The 5 Russell is reputed to have remarked that he was delighted to see that the Principia Mathematica could be done by machine, and that if he and Whitehead had known this in advance that they would not have wasted 10 years doing this work by hand in the early twentieth century. The LT program succeeded in proving 38 of the 52 theorems in Chapter 2 of Principia Mathematica. Its approach was to start with the theorem to be proved and to then search for relevant axioms and operators to prove the theorem. 6 Of course, the machine would somehow need to know what premises are relevant and should be selected for to apply the deductive method from the many premises that are already encoded. 5.3 The Field of Artiﬁcial Intelligence 157 Fig. 5.2 John McCarthy Courtesy of John McCarthy. program then performs actions that it infers are appropriate for achieving its goals. That is, common sense7 knowledge is formalised by logic, and common sense prob- lems are solved by logical reasoning. 5.3.1 Turing Test and Strong AI Turing contributed to the debate concerning artiﬁcial intelligence in his 1950 paper on Computing, machinery and intelligence [Tur:50]. Turing’s paper considered whether it could be possible for a machine to be conscious and to think. He predicted that it would be possible to speak of machines thinking and he devised a famous experiment that would allow a computer to be judged as a conscious and thinking machine. This is known as the “Turing Test”. The test itself is an adaptation of a well-known party game which involves three participants. One of them, the judge, is placed in a separate room from the other two: one is a male and the other is a female. Questions and responses are typed and passed under the door. The objective 7 Common sense includes basic facts about events, beliefs, actions, knowledge and desires. It also includes basic facts about objects and their properties. 158 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems of the game is for the judge to determine which participant is male and which is female. The male is allowed to deceive the judge whereas the female is supposed to assist. Turing adapted this game by allowing the role of the male to be played by a computer. If the judge could not tell which of the two participants was human or machine, then the computer could be considered intelligent. The test involves a judge who is engaged in a natural language conversation with two other parties, one party is a human and the other is a machine. If the judge cannot determine which is machine and which is human, then the machine is said to have passed the “Turing Test”. That is, a machine that passes the Turing Test must be considered intelligent, as it is indistinguishable from a human. The test is applied to test the linguistic capability of the machine rather than the audio capability, and the conversation is
