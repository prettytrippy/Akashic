of 4 feet, and the wheel turned 400 times in every mile.16 The device included gears and pebbles and a 400 tooth cogwheel that turned once every mile and caused one pebble to drop into a box. The total distance travelled was determined by counting the pebbles in the box. Aristotle was born in Macedonia and became a student of Plato in Athens. Plato had founded a school (known as Plato‚Äôs academy) in Athens in the fourth cen- tury BC, and this school remained open until 529 A.D. Aristotle became a famous philosopher in his own right and he founded his own school (known as the Lyceum) in Athens. He was also the teacher of Alexander the Great. Aristotle made contribu- tions to physics, biology, logic, politics, ethics and metaphysics. The work of Plato and Aristotle provided the foundations for Western philosophy (Fig. 1.7). Aristotle‚Äôs starting point to the acquisition of knowledge was the senses. He believed that the senses were essential to acquire knowledge. This position is the opposite from Plato who argued that the senses deceive and should not be relied upon. Plato‚Äôs writings are mainly in dialogues involving his former mentor Socrates.17 Most of Aristotle‚Äôs writings are in treatise form although he wrote some dialogues in his early career. Aquinus,18 a thirteenth century Christian theologian and philosopher, was deeply inÔ¨Çuenced by Aristotle, and referred to him as the philosopher. Acquinus was an empiricist (i.e., he believed that all knowledge was gained by sense experience), and he used some of Aristotle‚Äôs arguments to offer Ô¨Åve proofs of the existence of God. These arguments included the Cosmological argument and the Design argument. The Cosmological argument used Aristotle‚Äôs 15 The origin of the word ‚Äúodometer‚Äù is from the Greek words ‚ÄòoŒ¥o (meaning journey) and ŒºŒµo meaning (measure). 16 The Ô¨Ågures given here are for the distance of one Roman mile. This is given by œÄ22 ‚àó400 = 12.56 ‚àó400 = 5024 (which is less than 5280 feet for a standard mile in the Imperial system). 17 Socrates was a moral philosopher who deeply inÔ¨Çuenced Plato. His method of enquiry into philosophical problems and ethics was by questioning. Socrates himself maintained that he knew nothing (Socratic ignorance). However, from his questioning it became apparent that those who thought they were clever were not really that clever after all. His approach obviously would not have made him very popular with the citizens of Athens. Socrates had consulted the oracle at Delphi to Ô¨Ånd out who was the wisest of all men, and he was informed that there was no one wiser than him. Socrates was sentenced to death for allegedly corrupting the youth of Athens, and the sentence was carried out by Socrates being forced to take hemlock (a type of poison). The juice of the hemlock plant was prepared for Socrates to drink. 18 Aquinus‚Äôs (or St. Thomas‚Äôs) most famous work is Sumna Theologicae. 16 1 Early Civilisations Fig. 1.7 Plato and Aristotle ideas on the scientiÔ¨Åc method and causation. Acquius argued that there was a Ô¨Årst cause and he deduced that this Ô¨Årst cause is God. 1. Every effect has a cause 2. Nothing can cause itself 3. A causal chain cannot be of inÔ¨Ånite length 4. Therefore there must be a Ô¨Årst cause Aristotle made important contributions to formal reasoning with his development of syllogistic logic and foundational work in modal logic. His collected works on logic is called the Organon and it was used in his school in Athens. Syllogistic logic (also known as term logic) consists of reasoning with two premises and one conclusion. Each premise consists of two terms and there is a common middle term. The con- clusion links the two unrelated terms from the premises. This is best illustrated by an example: Premise 1 All Greeks are Mortal Premise 2 Socrates is a Greek. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Conclusion Socrates is Mortal 1.4 The Greeks 17 In this example the common middle term is ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù, and this term appears in the two premises. The two unrelated terms from the premises are ‚ÄúSocrates‚Äù and ‚ÄúMortal‚Äù. The relationship between the terms in the Ô¨Årst premise is that of the universal: i.e., anything or any person that is a Greek is mortal. The relationship between the terms in the second premise is that of the particular: i.e., Socrates is a person that is a Greek. The conclusion from the two premises is that Socrates is
