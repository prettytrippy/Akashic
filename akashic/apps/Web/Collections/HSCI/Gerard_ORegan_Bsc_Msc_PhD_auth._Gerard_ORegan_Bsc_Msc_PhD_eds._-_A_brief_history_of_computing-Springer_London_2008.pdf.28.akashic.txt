each iteration achieving a closer approximation to π. The Chinese made contributions to number theory including the summation of arithmetic series and solving simultaneous congruences. The Chinese remainder theorem deals with ﬁnding the solutions to a set of simultaneous congruences in modular arithmetic. Chinese astronomers made accurate observations which were used to produce a new calendar in the sixth century. This was known as the Taming Calendar and it was based on a cycle of 391 years. Indian mathematicians have made major contributions to the development of mathematics. One key contribution of Indian mathematicians is to the development of the decimal notation for numbers that is now used throughout the world. The dec- imal system was developed in India sometime between 400 BC and 400 AD. Indian mathematicians also invented zero and negative numbers, and also did early work on the trigonometric functions of sine and cosine The knowledge of the decimal numerals reached Europe through Arabic mathematicians, and the resulting system is known as the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. The Sulva Sutras is a Hindu text that documents Indian mathematics and it dates from about 400 BC. The Indian mathematicians were familiar with the state- ment and proof of Pythagoras’s theorem, and were familiar with Rational numbers, quadratic equations, as well as the calculation of the square root of 2 to ﬁve decimal places. Panini was a ﬁfth century BC. Indian mathematician and linguist who did pio- neering work on phonetics and morphology for the Sanskrit language. His work on grammar allowed sentences to be formed from a set of rules, and is the earliest known work on linguistics and formal grammars. 1.8 Review Questions 1. Describe the number systems employed by the various civilizations dis- cussed in this chapter and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each system. 2. Describe ciphers used during the Roman civilization and write a program to implement one of these. What were the disadvantages of these ciphers and how would you improve upon them? 1.9 Summary 25 3. Discuss the nature of an algorithm and its importance in computing. Describe any algorithm that you are familiar and implement in a program- ming language of your choice. 4. Discuss the working of an abacus and its application to calculation. 5. Discuss syllogistic logic and identify strengths and weaknesses of the logic. Discuss the similarities and differences between syllogistic logic and propositional and predicate logic. 1.9 Summary The last decades of the twentieth century have witnessed a proliferation of high-tech computers, mobile phones, and information technology. Software is now pervasive and it is included in automobiles, airplanes, televisions, and mobile communication. It is only in recent decades that technology has become an integral part of the west- ern world, and the pace of change has been extraordinary. It has led to increases in industrial productivity and potentially allows humans the freedom to engage in more creative and rewarding tasks. This chapter considered the contributions of early civilisations in providing a primitive foundation for what has become computer science. It included a discussion on the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans as well as contribu- tions from Islamic scholars. The Babylonian civilization ﬂourished from about 2000 BC and they produced clay cuneiform tablets containing mathematical texts. These included tables for mul- tiplication, division, squares, and square roots as well as the calculation of area and the solution of linear and quadratic equations. The Egyptian Civilization developed along the Nile from about 4000 BC and lasted until the Roman Empire. They used mathematics for practical problem solv- ing, and this included measuring time, measuring the annual Nile ﬂooding, calculat- ing the area of land, solving baking problems. The use of mathematics was essential in constructing pyramids. The Greeks made major contributions to western civilization including math- ematics, logic, philosophy, politics, drama, and architecture. Euclid developed a systematic treatment of geometry starting from a small set of axioms, postulates and deﬁnitions to derive and prove a comprehensive set of theorems. Euclid’s Elements has been in use as a textbook for over 2000 years. The Romans developed a cumbersome number system that is still used in clocks today. They also developed the Julian calendar and employed simple ciphers to ensure that information communicated was kept conﬁdential. The Islamic contri- bution helped to preserve the earlier work of the Greeks, and they also developed mathematics and algebra further. Later Islamic scholars applied algebra to arith- metic and geometry.
