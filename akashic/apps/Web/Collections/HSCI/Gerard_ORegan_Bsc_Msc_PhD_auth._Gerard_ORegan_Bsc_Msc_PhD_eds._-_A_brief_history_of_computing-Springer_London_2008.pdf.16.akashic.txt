This is described in Plato‚Äôs Republic. 4 1 Early Civilisations Greek architecture and sculpture is evident from the Parthenon on the Acropolis, and the Elgin marbles5 that are housed today in the British Museum, London. The Hellenistic6 period commenced with Alexander the Great and led to the spread of Greek culture throughout Asia Minor and as far as Egypt. The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great, and it became a center of learning and knowledge during the Hellenistic period. Among the well-known scholars at Alexandria was Euclid who provided a systematic foundation for geometry. Euclid‚Äôs work on geometry is known as ‚ÄúThe Elements‚Äù, and it consists of thirteen books. The early books are concerned with the construction of geometric Ô¨Ågures, number theory and solid geometry. There are many words of Greek origin that are part of the English language. These include words such as psychology which is derived from two Greek words: psyche (  ) and logos ( oo). The Greek word ‚Äúpsyche‚Äù means mind or soul, and the word ‚Äúlogos‚Äù means an account or discourse. Other examples are anthropol- ogy derived from ‚Äúanthropos‚Äù (Œ±oo) and ‚Äúlogos‚Äù (Œªoo). The Romans were inÔ¨Çuenced by the culture of the Greeks, and the Greek lan- guage, culture and philosophy was taught in Rome and in the wider Roman Empire. The Romans were great builders and their contributions include the construction of buildings such as aqueducts, viaducts, baths, and amphitheatres. Other achievements include the Julian calendar, the formulation of laws (lex), and the maintenance of law and order and peace throughout the Roman Empire. The peace that the Romans brought is known as pax Romano. The ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum (both located near Naples in Italy) demonstrate the engineering maturity of the Roman Empire. The Roman numbering system is still employed today in clocks and for page numbering in documents. However, as a notation it is cumbersome for serious computation. The collapse of the Roman Empire in Western Europe led to a decline in knowledge and learning in Europe. However, the eastern part of the Roman Empire continued at Constantinople (now known as Istanbul in Turkey) until its sacking by the Ottomans in 1453. 1.2 The Babylonians The Babylonian7 civilization Ô¨Çourished in Mesopotamia (in modern Iraq) from about 2000 BC until about 300 BC. Various clay cuneiform tablets containing math- ematical texts were discovered and later deciphered by Grotefend and Rawlinson in the nineteenth century [Smi:23]. These included tables for multiplication, division, squares, cubes and square roots; measurement of area and length; and the solution 5 The Elgin marbles are named after Lord Elgin who moved them from the Parthenon in Athens to London in 1806. The marbles show the Pan-Athenaic festival that was held in Athens in honour of the goddess Athena after whom Athens is named. 6 The origin of the word Hellenistic is from Hellene (‚ÄúE  ‚Äù) meaning Greek. 7 The hanging gardens of Babylon were one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. 1.2 The Babylonians 5 of linear and quadratic equations. The late Babylonian period (c. 300 BC) includes work on astronomy. The Babylonians recorded their mathematics on soft clay using a wedge shaped instrument to form impressions of the cuneiform numbers. The clay tablets were then baked in an oven or by the heat of the sun. They employed just two symbols (1 and 10) to represent numbers, and these symbols were then combined to form all other numbers. They employed a positional number system8 and used base 60 system. The symbol representing 1 could also (depending on the context) repre- sent 60, 602, 603, etc. It could also mean 1/60, 1/3600, and so on. There was no zero employed in the system and there was no decimal point (strictly speaking no ‚Äúsexagesimal point‚Äù), and therefore the context was essential. The example above illustrates the cuneiform notation and represents the number 60 + 10 + 1 = 71. The Babylonians used the base 60 system for computation, and this base is still in use today in the division of hours into minutes and the division of minutes into seconds. One possible explanation for the use of base 60 is the ease of dividing 60 into parts as it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. They were able to represent large and small numbers and had no difÔ¨Åculty in working
