1.6 Islamic Inﬂuence 21 Plaintext Summer Solstice Cipher Text vxpphu vrovwleh The process of deciphering a cipher message involves doing the reverse opera- tion: i.e., for each cipher letter the corresponding plaintext letter is identiﬁed from the table. Cipher Text vxpphu vrovwleh Plaintext Summer Solstice The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by ﬁrst using the numbers 0–25 to represent the alphabet letters, and then using addition (modula 26) to perform the encryption. That is, the encoding of the plaintext letter repre- sented by the number x is given by: c = x + 3 (mod 26) Similarly, the decoding of a cipher letter represented by the number c is given by: x = c −3 (mod 26) The emperor Augustus24 employed a similar substitution cipher (with a shift key of 1). The Caesar cipher was still in use up to the early twentieth century. How- ever, by then frequency analysis techniques were available to break the cipher. The Vign`ere cipher uses a Caesar cipher with a different shift at each position in the text. The value of the shift to be employed with each plaintext letter is deﬁned using a repeating keyword. The famous library in Alexandria was once the largest library in the world. It was build during the Hellenistic period in the third century BC. Caesar’s campaign in Egypt in 48 BC caused damage to the library, and the library was ﬁnally destroyed by ﬁre in 391 A.D. The new library in Alexandria was inaugurated in 2003 on the site of the old library. 1.6 Islamic Inﬂuence Islamic mathematics refers to mathematics developed in the Islamic world from the birth of Islam in the early seventh century up until the seventeenth century. The Islamic world commenced with Mohammed in Mecca, and spread throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Spain. Islamic scholars translated the works of 24 Augustus was the ﬁrst Roman emperor and his reign ushered in a period of peace and stability following the bitter civil wars. He was the adopted son of Julius Caesar and was called Octavion before he became emperor. The earlier civil wars were between Caesar and Pompey, and following Caesar’s assassination civil war broke out between Mark Anthony and Octavion. Octavion defeated Anthony and Cleopatra at the battle of Actium. 22 1 Early Civilisations the Greeks into Arabic, and this led to the preservation of the Greek texts dur- ing the Dark ages in Europe. Further, the Islamic scholars developed the existing mathematics further. The Islamic contribution ﬁlled the void that followed the end of the Roman Empire in the sixth century A.D. The Moors25 invaded Spain in the eighth century A.D., and they ruled large parts of the Iberian Peninsula for several centuries. The Moorish inﬂuence26 in Spain continued until the time of the Catholic Monarchs27 in the ﬁfteenth century. Ferdinand and Isabella united Spain, defeated the Moors, and expelled them from Spain. The Islamic mathematicians and scholars were based in several countries includ- ing Iran, Iraq, Turkey, North Africa and Spain. Early work commenced in Baghdad, and the mathematicians were inﬂuenced by the work of Hindu mathematicians who had introduced the decimal system and decimal numerals. There was a renaissance in European learning and interest in mathematics in the seventeenth century, and the Islamic texts played a key part in the revival. Many caliphs (Muslim rulers) were enlightened and encouraged scholarship in mathematics and science. The initial work done was the translation of the exist- ing Greek texts, and this led to a centre of translation and research in Baghdad. The translations were done as part of the research effort and included the works of Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius and Diophantus. Al-Khwarizmi28 made contribu- tions to early classical algebra, and the word algebra comes from the Arabic word “al jabr” that appears in a text book by Al-Khwarizmi. Early work in algebra had been done by the Babylonians, Egyptians and Greeks. The Babylonians had a general procedure for solving quadratic equations but there was limited use of symbols for unknowns. The Greeks represented quantities as geometrical magnitudes. Later Greek mathematicians such as Diophantus devel- oped algebra for solving Diophantine equations. This included solving equations in several unknowns. The Islamic contribution to algebra was an advance on the achievements of the Greeks. They developed a broader theory that treated ratio- nal and irrational numbers as algebraic objects, and moved away from the Greek concept of mathematics as being essentially Geometry. Later Islamic scholars built on Al-Khwarizmi’s work, and applied algebra to arithmetic and geometry. This
