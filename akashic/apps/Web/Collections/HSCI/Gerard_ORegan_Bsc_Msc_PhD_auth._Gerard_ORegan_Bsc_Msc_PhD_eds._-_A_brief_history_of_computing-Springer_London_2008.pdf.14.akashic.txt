The last decades of the twentieth century have witnessed a proliferation of high-tech comput- ers, mobile phones, text-messaging, the internet and the world-wide web. Software is now pervasive and it is an integral part of automobiles, airplanes, televisions, and mobile communication. The pace of change as a result of all this new technology has been extraordinary. Today consumers may book ﬂights over the world-wide web as well as keeping in contact with family members in any part of the world via email or mobile phone. In previous generations, communication often involved writing letters that took months to reach the recipient. Communication improved with the telegrams and the telephone in the late nineteenth century. Communica- tion today is instantaneous with text-messaging, mobile phones and email, and the new generation probably views the world of their parents and grandparents as being old-fashioned. The new technologies have led to major beneﬁts1 to society and to improvements in the standard of living for many citizens in the western world. It has also reduced 1 Of course, while the new technologies are of major beneﬁt to society it is essential that the population of the world moves towards more sustainable development to ensure the long-term survival of the planet for future generations. This involves ﬁnding technological and other solutions 1 2 1 Early Civilisations the necessity for humans to perform some of the more tedious or dangerous manual tasks, as many of these may now be automated by computers. The increase in pro- ductivity due to the more advanced computerized technologies has allowed humans, at least in theory, the freedom to engage in more creative and rewarding tasks. This chapter considers work done on computation by early civilizations includ- ing the work done by our ancestors in providing a primitive foundation for what has become computer science. Early societies are discussed and their contributions to the computing ﬁeld are considered. There is a close relationship between the technological or computation maturity of a civilization and the sophistication of its language. Clearly, societies that have evolved technically will have invented words to reﬂect the technology that they use on a daily basis. Clearly, hunter-gatherer or purely agrarian societies will have a more limited technical vocabulary which reﬂects that technology is not part of their day to day culture. Language evolves with the development of the civilisation, and new words are introduced to describe new inventions in the society. Communities that have a very stable unchanging existence (e.g., hunter gatherer or pastoral societies) have no need to introduce names for com- plex scientiﬁc entities, as these words are outside their day-to-day experience. The language of these communities mirrors the thought processes of these communities. Early societies had a limited vocabulary for counting: e.g., “one, two, three, many” is associated with some primitive societies, and indicates primitive computa- tion and scientiﬁc ability. It suggests that there was no need for more sophisticated arithmetic in the primitive culture as the problems dealt with were elementary. These early societies would typically have employed their ﬁngers for counting, and as humans have 5 ﬁngers on each hand and ﬁve toes on each foot then the obvious bases would have been 5, 10 and 20. Traces of the earlier use of the base 20 system are still apparent in modern languages such as English and French. This includes phrases such as “three score” in English and “quatre vingt” in French. The decimal system (base 10) is familiar to most in western society, and it may
