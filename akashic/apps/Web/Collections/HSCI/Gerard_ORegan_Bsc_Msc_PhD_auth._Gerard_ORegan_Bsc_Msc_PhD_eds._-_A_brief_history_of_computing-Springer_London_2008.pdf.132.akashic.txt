to the iPod. Apple is a highly innovative company and has made major contributions to the history of computing. 7.6 Oracle Oracle was founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner and Ed Oates. Ellison came across a working prototype of a relational database, and he saw an opportunity to exploit and commercialise relational database technology. At that time there were no relational databases in the world, and the founding of Oracle changed business computing. The company was originally called Software Development Laborato- ries, and it changed its name to Oracle in 1983. The database product that Ellison, Milner and Oates created was called Oracle in memory of a CIA funded project code named Oracle that they had worked on in a previous company. Today, Oracle is the main standard for database technology and applications, and Oracle databases are used by companies throughout the world. Oracle has grown over time to become the second largest software company12 in the world. An Oracle database consists of a collection of data managed by an Oracle database manage- ment system. The release of Oracle V.2 in 1979 was a major milestone in the history of computing as it was the world’s ﬁrst relational database. The concept of a relational database was described by Edgar Codd [Cod:70]. Codd was born in England and he worked for IBM in the United States. A relational database is a database that conforms to the relational model, and it may also be deﬁned as a set of relations (or tables). A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a system that manages data using the relational model, and examples include products such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. 12 Microsoft is the largest software company in the world. 7.7 Siemens 229 A relation is deﬁned as a set of tuples and is usually represented by a table, where a table is data organized in rows and columns. The data stored in a each column of the table is of the same data type. Constraints may be employed to provide restrictions on the kinds of data that may be stored in the relations. Constraints are Boolean expressions which indicate whether the constraint holds or not, and are a way of implementing business rules into the database. Most relations have one or more key associated with them, and the key uniquely identiﬁes the row of the table. An index is a way of providing quicker access to the data in a relational database. It allows the tuple in a relation to be looked up directly (using the index) rather than checking all of the tuples in the relation. A stored procedure is executable code that is associated with the database. It is usually written in an imperative programming language, and it is used to perform common operations on the database. Oracle is recognised as a world leader in relational database technology and its products play a key role in business computing. 7.7 Siemens Siemens is a European technology giant and it employs approximately 475,000 people around the world. It is one of the world’s leading electrical engineering and electronics companies, and its headquarters are in Munich and Berlin. Its annual sales are in excess of e 87 billion. The company operates in several segments including automation and control, power, transportation, medical, and information and communications. It was founded in 1847 by Werner von Siemens, and initially the focus of the company was in telecommunications with a product that improved upon the Wheatstone Telegraph. The company was involved in building telegraph networks in Prussia and Russia, as well as building an Indo-European13 telegraph network in its early years. The company began laying the ﬁrst transatlantic cable from Ireland to the United States in 1874. Siemens played a role in the introduction of facsimile telegraphy in the 1920s. This involved the scanning of photographs and it was employed on Siemens equipment from the late 1920s. It proved to be very popular with the press as it made it easier to transmit photographs. Siemens played a role in launching the world’s ﬁrst public telex network in work that it did with Deutsche Reichpost in 1933. This was achieved by technology to type and receive messages. Siemens became the ﬁrst company to succeed in manufacturing the ultra-pure silicon needed for semiconductor components. This was done in 1953 and was independent of the research being done in the United States. This technique was known as the ﬂoating-zone method, and the company was granted a patent for this 13 The construction took 2 years and the route was over 11,000 km.
