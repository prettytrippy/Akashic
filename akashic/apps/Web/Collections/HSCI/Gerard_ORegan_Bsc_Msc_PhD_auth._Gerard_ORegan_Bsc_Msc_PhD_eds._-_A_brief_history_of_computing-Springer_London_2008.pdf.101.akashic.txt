5.7 Cybernetics 167 The study of syntax includes the study of the rules of grammar, and the gram- mar determines the way by which valid sentences and phrases are produced in the language. It also includes the study of morphology and phonetics. Morphology is concerned with the formation and alteration of words, and phonetics is concerned with the study of sounds, and how sounds are produced and perceived as speech (or non-speech). Computational Linguistics is the study of the design and analysis of natural language processing systems. It is an interdisciplinary Ô¨Åeld and includes linguists, computer scientists, experts in artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence, cognitive psychologists, and mathematicians. Human language is highly complex, and this is reÔ¨Çected in the sophistication of human intelligence. Computational linguistics originated in the United States in the 1950s in an effort to design software to translate texts written in foreign languages into English. The objective at that time was to develop an automated mechanism by which Russian language texts could be translated directly into English without human intervention. It was believed that given the speed and power of the emerging computer technol- ogy that it was only a matter of time before it would be possible by design soft- ware to analyse Russian texts and to automatically provide a corresponding English translation. However, the initial results of automated machine translation of human languages were not very successful, and it was realised that the automated processing of human languages was considerably more complex than initially believed. This led to the birth of a new Ô¨Åeld called computational linguistics, and the objective of this Ô¨Åeld is to investigate and to develop algorithms and software for processing natural lan- guages. It is a sub-Ô¨Åeld of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence, and deals with the comprehension and production of natural languages. The task of translating one language into another requires an understanding of the grammar of both languages. This includes an understanding of the syntax, the morphology, semantics and pragmatics of the language. For ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence to become a reality it will need to make major breakthroughs in computational lin- guistics. 5.7 Cybernetics The interdisciplinary Ô¨Åeld of cybernetics21 began in the late 1940s when concepts such as information, feedback, and regulation were generalized from engineering to other systems. These include systems such as living organisms, machines, robots and language. The term ‚Äúcybernetics‚Äù was coined by Norma Wiener, and it taken from the Greek word ‚Äú ¬¥‚Äù (meaning steersman or governor). 21 Cybernetics was deÔ¨Åned by CoufÔ¨Ågnal (one of its pioneers) as the art of ensuring the efÔ¨Åcacy of action. 168 5 ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence and Expert Systems The name is appropriate as a steersman has a set of goals in traveling to a particular destination, and will need to respond to different conditions on the jour- ney. Similarly, the Ô¨Åeld of cybernetics is concerned with an interaction of goals, predictions, actions, feedback, and response in systems of all kinds. It is the study of communications and control and feedback in living organisms and machines to ensure efÔ¨Åcient action. Practitioners of cybernetics use models of organisations, feedback and goals to understand the capacity and limits of any system. Cybernetics is concerned with approaches to acquire knowledge through con- trol and feedback, and it is a branch of applied epistemology. The principles of cybernetics are similar to the way that humans acquire knowledge (e.g., learning is achieved through a continuous process of transformation of behaviour through feedback from parents and peers, rather than an explicit encoding of knowledge). The systems studied include observed systems and observing systems (systems that explicitly incorporate the observer into the system). AI is based on the assumption that knowledge is something that can be stored inside a machine, and that the application of stored knowledge to the real world in this way constitutes intelligence. External objects are mapped to internal states on the machine, and machine intelligence is manifested by the manipulation of the internal states. This approach has been reasonably successful with rule-based expert systems. However, the progress of AI in creating intelligent machines has not been very successful to date, and an alternative approach based on cybernetics may become more important in the future. Cybernetics views information (or intelligence) as an attribute of an interaction, rather than something that is stored in a computer. The concepts of cybernetics have become part of other disciplines, and it may have an important role to play in the ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence Ô¨Åeld. 5.8 Logic and AI Logic is a key discipline in the AI Ô¨Åeld, and the goal is to use mathematical logic to formalise knowledge and reasoning to enable AI problems to be solved. John McCarthy and others have argued that mathematical logic has a key role to play
