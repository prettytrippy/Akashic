then be computed using just additions of pairs of cells in the table. The ﬁrst row of Table 2.5 is given by the cells 6, 9 and 4, and this allows the rest of the table to be determined. The numbers in the table below have been derived by simple calculations from the ﬁrst row. The procedure for calculation of the table is as follows. 1. The Difference 2 column is the constant 4. 2. The calculation of the cell in row i for the Difference 1 column is given by Diff. 1(i–1) + Diff. 2 (i–1) 3. The calculation of the cell in row i for the function column is given by f (i–1) + Diff. 1(i–1) In other words, to calculate the value of a particular cell, all that is required is to add the value in the cell immediately above it to the value of the cell immediately to its right. Therefore, in the second row, the calculations 6 + 9 yields 15, and 9 + 4 yields 13, and, since the last column is always a constant it is just repeated. Therefore, the second row is 15, 13 and 4 and f (2) is 15. Similarly, the third row yields 15 + 13 = 28, 13 + 4 = 17, and so on. This is the underlying procedure of the Difference Engine.

The Difference Engine cannot compute a particular value, and its approach is to calculate successive values starting from a known one and the ﬁrst row of differences. The computation of the ﬁrst row for the example above is easy, but it is more difﬁcult for more complex polynomials. The other problem is to ﬁnd a suitable polynomial to represent the function that you wish to calculate. This may be done by interpolation. However, once these problems are solved the engine produces pages and columns full of data. Babbage had received funding to build the Difference Engine but never delivered a complete system. He received over £17K of taxpayers funds, but for various rea- sons he only produced prototypes of the intended machine. Therefore, the return to the exchequer was limited, and the government obviously had little enthusiasm for the other projects that Babbage was proposing. The project to build the Difference Engine was ofﬁcially cancelled by the British government in 1842. Various prototypes of parts of the Difference Engine machine had been built by Babbage and his engineer Joseph Clement, but these machines were limited to the computation of quadratic polynomials of six digit numbers. The Difference Engine envisaged by Babbage was intended to operate on 6th order polynomials of 20 digits. Such a machine would take up the space of a complete room. Babbage designed an improved difference engine (No. 2) in 1849 (Fig. 2.7). It could operate on 7th order differences (i.e., polynomials of order 7) and 31-digit numbers. A polynomial of degree 7 is of the form p(x) = ax7 + bx6 + cx5 + dx4 + ex3 + fx2 + gx + h. The machine consisted of eight columns with each column Fig. 2.7 Difference engine No. 2 Photo courtesy of Wikipedia. 42 2 Foundations consisting of thirty one wheels.11 However, no one was interested in his design and it was never built in his lifetime. It was built 150 years later (in 1991) by the science museum in London to mark the two hundredth anniversary of Babbage’s birth in. The science museum also built the printer that Babbage had designed. Both the difference engine and the printer worked correctly according to Babbage’s design (after a little debugging). 2.3.3 Analytic Engine A key weakness of the Difference Engine is that it requires the intervention of humans to perform the calculation. Babbage recognised this weakness of the engine, and he proposed a revolutionary idea to resolve this. His plan was to construct a new machine that would be capable of analysis, and this machine would be capable of executing all possible tasks that may be expressed in algebraic notation. The new machine would do substantially more than the arithmetical calculations performed by the difference engine, which was essentially limited to the production of tables. The Analytic Engine envisioned by Babbage consisted of two parts (Table 2.6):
