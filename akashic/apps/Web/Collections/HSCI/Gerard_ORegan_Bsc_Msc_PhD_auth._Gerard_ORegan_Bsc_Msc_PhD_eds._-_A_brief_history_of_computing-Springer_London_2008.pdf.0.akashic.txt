The computing ﬁeld is a vast area and a truly compre- hensive account of its history would require several volumes. The aims of this book are more modest, and its goals are to give the reader a ﬂavour of some of the key topics and events in the history of computing. It is hoped that this will stimulate the interested reader to study the more advanced books and articles available. The history of computing has its origins in the dawn of civilization. Early hunter gatherer societies needed to be able to perform elementary calculations such as counting and arithmetic. As societies evolved into towns and communities there was a need for more sophisticated calculations. This included primitive accounting to determine the appropriate taxation to be levied as well as the development of geometry to enable buildings, templates and bridges to be constructed. Our account commences with the contributions of the Egyptians, and Babylonians. It moves on to the foundational work done by Boole and Babbage in the nineteenth century, and to the important work on Boolean Logic and circuit design done by Claude Shannon in the 1930s. The theoretical work done by Turing on computability is considered as well as work done by von Neumann and others on the fundamental architecture for computers. The various generations of programming languages that have been developed over the last 50 years are then considered. This includes machine code used in the early days of programming; low-level assembly languages; high-level programming languages such as C and Pascal, and so on. The important ﬁeld of software engi- neering is then considered, and this chapter considers various software engineer- ing methodologies to design and develop high-quality software to meet customers’ requirements. This includes a discussion on theoretical mathematical approaches as well as practical industrial approaches using the CMMI. The ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence is then considered starting with Greek mythol- ogy on creating life and intelligence. The Turing test developed by Alan Turing to judge whether a machine may be considered intelligent is considered as well as Searle’s rebuttal argument on Artiﬁcial Intelligence. vii viii Preface Next, the development of the internet and world-wide web is considered. This includes the work done by DARPA on the internet as well as the work done by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN that led to the birth of the world-wide web. Applications of the world-wide web are considered as well as the dot com bubble and eventual collapse. Finally, the contributions of various well-known technology companies are con- sidered. These include companies such as International Business Machines (IBM), Microsoft, and Motorola. Organization and Features The ﬁrst chapter discusses the contributions made by early civilizations to com- putation. This includes work done by the Babylonians, Egyptians and Greeks. The Babylonians recorded their mathematics on soft clay which they then baked in ovens. The Egyptians applied their mathematics to solving practical problems including the construction of pyramids as well as various accounting problems. The
