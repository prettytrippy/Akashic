telnet protocol and ﬁle transfer protocol (FTP) in 1971. The telnet program allowed the user of one computer to remotely log in to the computer of another computer. The ﬁle transfer protocol allows the user of one computer to send or receive ﬁles from another computer. A public demonstration of ARPANET was made in 1972 and it was a huge success. One of the earliest demos was that of Weizenbaum’s ELIZA program. This is a famous AI program that allows a user to conduct a typed conversation with an artiﬁcially intelligent machine (psychiatrist) at MIT. The via- bility of packet switching as a standard for network communication had been clearly demonstrated. Ray Tomlinson of BBN Technologies developed a program that allowed elec- tronic mail to be sent over the ARPANET. Tomlinson developed the “user@host” convention, and this was eventually to become the standard for electronic mail in the late 1980s. By the early 1970s over thirty institutions were connected to the ARPANET. These included consulting organisations such as BBN, Xerox, and the MITRE Cor- poration, and government organisations such as NASA. Bob Metacalfe developed 6.3 TCP/IP 183 a wire-based local area network (LAN) at Xerox that would eventually become Ethernet in the mid-1970s. 6.3 TCP/IP ARPA became DARPA (Defence Advance Research Projects Agency) in 1973, and it commenced work on a project connecting seven computers on four islands using a radio based network, as well as a project to establish a satellite connection between a site in Norway and in the United Kingdom. This led to a need for the interconnection of the ARPANET with other networks. The key problems were to investigate ways of achieving convergence between ARPANET, radio-based networks, and the satel- lite networks, as these all had different interfaces, packet sizes, and transmission rates. Therefore, there was a need for a network to network connection protocol, and its development would prove to be an important step towards developing the internet. An international network working group (INWG) was formed in 1973. The con- cept of the transmission control protocol (TCP) was developed at DARPA by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf, and they presented their ideas at an INWG meeting at the University of Sussex in England in 1974 [KaC:74]. TCP allowed cross network connections, and it began to replace the original NCP protocol used in ARPANET. However, it would take some time for the existing and new networks to adopt the TCP protocol. TCP is a set of network standards that specify the details of how computers com- municate, as well as the standards for interconnecting networks and computers. It was designed to be ﬂexible and provides a transmission standard that deals with physical differences in host computers, routers, and networks. TCP is designed to transfer data over networks which support different packet sizes and which may sometimes lose packets. It allows the inter-networking of very different networks which then act as one network. The new protocol standards were known as the transport control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP). TCP details how information is broken into packets and re-assembled on delivery, whereas IP is focused on sending the packet across the network. These standards allow users to send electronic mail or to transfer ﬁles electronically, without needing to concern themselves with the physical differences in the networks. TCP/IP is a family or suite of protocols, and it consists of four layers (Table 6.1): The internet protocol (IP) is a connectionless protocol that is responsible for addressing and routing packets. It is responsible for breaking up and assembling packets, with large packets broken down into smaller packets when they are trav- elling through a network that supports smaller packets. A connectionless protocol means that a session is not established before data is exchanged. Packet delivery with IP is not guaranteed as packets may be lost or delivered out of sequence. An acknowledgement is not sent when data is received, and the sender or receiver is not 184 6 The Internet Revolution Table 6.1 TCP layers Layer Description Network Interface Layer This layer is responsible for formatting packets, and placing them on to the underlying network. It is equivalent to the physical and data link layers on OSI Model. Internet Layer This layer is responsible for network addressing. It includes the internet protocol, the address resolution protocol, and so on. It is equivalent to the network layer on the OSI Model. Transport Layer This layer is concerned with data transport, and is implemented by TCP and the user datagram protocol (UDP). It is equivalent to the transport and session layers in the OSI Model. Application Layer This layer is responsible for liaising between user applications and the transport layer. The applications include the ﬁle transfer protocol (FTP), telnet, domain naming system (DNS), and
