concept of phenomenology further by introducing the concept of the body-subject. This concept is distinct from the Cartesian view that the world is just an extension of our own mind, and instead takes the position that the world and the human body are mutually intertwined. That is, in the Cartesian viewpoint it is ﬁrst necessary for the self to be aware of and to recognize its own existence prior to being aware of and recognizing the existence of anything else. The body-subject concept expresses the embodied feeling of reality that all humans share. Merleau-Ponty argued that the body plays a key role in the process of human understanding. The body has the ability to perceive the world and it plays a double role in that it is both the subject (i.e., the perceiver) and the object (i.e., the entity being perceived) of experience. Human understanding and perception is dependent on the body’s capacity to perceive via the senses, and its ability to interrogate its environment. Merleau-Ponty argued that there is a symbiotic relationship between the perceiver and what is being perceived, and he argues that as our consciousness develops the self imposes richer and richer meanings on objects. He provides a detailed analysis of the ﬂow of information between the body-subject and the world. Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology that is concerned with learning, language, memory and internal mental processes. Its roots lie in the child develop- ment psychology developed by Piaget, and in the Gesalt psychology developed by Wertheimer. The latter argues that the operations of the mind are holistic, and that the mind contains a self-organising mechanism. The philosophical position known as Holism argues that the sum of the parts is less than the whole subject, and it is the opposite of the philosophical position of logical Atomism20 developed by Bertrand Russell. Russell (and also Wittgenstein) attempted to identify the atoms of thought: i.e., the elements of thought that cannot be divided into smaller pieces. The philo- sophical position of logical atomism was that all truths are ultimately dependent on 19 Merleau-Ponty was a French philosopher who was strongly inﬂuenced by the phenomenology of Husserl. He was also closely associated with the French existentialist philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir. 20 Atomism actually goes back to the work of the ancient Greeks and was originally developed by Democritus and his teacher Leucippus in the ﬁfth century BC. Atomism was rejected by Plato in the dialogue the Timaeus. 166 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems a layer of atomic facts. It had an associated methodology whereby by a process of analysis it attempted to construct more complex notions in terms of simpler ones. Cognitive psychology is concerned with how people understand, diagnose, and solve problems, and the mental processes that take place during a stimulus and its corresponding response. It argues that solutions to problems take the form of rules, heuristics and sudden insight. It was developed in the late 1950s, and it views the mind as having a certain conceptual structure. Cognition is considered as the pro- cesses by which the sensory input is transformed and used. The dominant paradigm in the ﬁeld has been the information processing model, and this viewpoint considers the mental processes of thinking and reasoning as being equivalent to the software running on the computer: i.e., the brain. The information processing model has asso- ciated theories of input, representation of knowledge, processing of knowledge and output. Cognitive psychology has been applied to artiﬁcial intelligence from the 1960s, and it has played an important role in the integration of various approaches to the mind and mental processes. Some of the research areas in cognitive psychology include: r Perception r Concept Formation r Memory r Knowledge Representation r Learning r Language r Grammar and Linguistics r Thinking r Logic and Problem Solving The success of these research areas in cognitive psychology will strongly inﬂuence developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence. For a machine to behave with intelligence it must be able to perceive objects of the physical world and form concepts about the world. It must be able to remember knowledge that it has already been provided with, as well as possessing an understanding of temporal events. There must be a way to represent knowledge in a machine that allows the knowledge to be easily retrieved and used in analysis and decision making. For a machine to exhibit intel- ligence it must possess an understanding of language. That is, it must be capable of understanding written language as well as possessing the ability to communicate in written or audio form. A thinking machine must be capable of thought, analysis and problem solving. 5.6 Linguistics Linguistics is the theoretical or applied scientiﬁc study of language. Theoretical linguistics is concerned with the study of syntax and semantics, whereas applied linguistics is concerned with putting linguistic theories into practice.
