n ‚àó2 +n ‚àó2+ n ‚àó2 +n. Similarly, if they wished to divide 27 by 7 they would note that 7 ‚àó2 + 7 = 21 and that 27 ‚àí21 = 6 and that therefore the answer was 36/7. Egyptian mathematics was cumbersome and the writing of their mathematics was long and repetitive. For example, they wrote a number such as 22 by 10+10+1+1. The Egyptians calculated the approximate area of a circle by calculating the area of a square 8/9 of the diameter of a circle. That is, instead of calculating the area in terms of our familiar œÄr2 their approximate calculation yielded (8/9 ‚àó2r)2 = 256/81 r2 or 3.16 r2. Their approximation of œÄ was 256/81 or 3.16. They were able to calculate the area of a triangle and volumes. The Moscow papyrus includes a problem to calculate the volume of the frustum. The formula for the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid12 was given by V = 1/3 h(b2 1 +b1b2 +b2 2) and when b2 is 0 then the well-known formula for the volume of a pyramid is given: i.e., 1/3 hb2 1. 1.4 The Greeks The Greeks made major contributions to western civilization including mathemat- ics, logic, astronomy, philosophy, politics, drama, and architecture. The Greek world of 500 BC consisted of several independent city states such as Athens and Sparta, and various city states in Asia Minor. The Greek polis (o ) or city state tended to be quite small, and consisted of the Greek city and a certain amount of territory outside the city state. Each city state had political structures for its citizens, and these varied from city state to city state. Some were oligarchs where political power was maintained in the hands of a few individuals or aristocratic families. Others were ruled by tyrants (or sole rulers) who sometimes took power by force, but who often had a lot of support from the public. The tyrants included people such as Solon, Peisistratus and Cleisthenes in Athens. The reforms by Cleisthenes led to the introduction of the Athenian democracy. This was the world‚Äôs Ô¨Årst democracy, and power was fully placed in the hands of the citizens. The citizens were male members of the population, and women or slaves did not participate. The form of democracy in ancient Athens differed from the representative democracy that we are familiar with today. It was an extremely liberal democracy where citizens voted on all important issues. Often, this led to disastrous results as speakers who were skilled in rhetoric could exert signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on the decision making. Philosophers such as Plato were against democracy as a form 12 The length of a side of the bottom base of the pyramid is b1 and the length of a side of the top base is b2 10 1 Early Civilisations of government for the state, and Plato‚Äôs later political thinking advocated rule by philosopher kings. These rulers were required to study philosophy and mathematics for many years. The rise of Macedonia led to the Greek city states being conquered by Philip of Macedonia. This was followed by the conquests of Alexander the Great who was one of the greatest military commanders in history. He defeated the Persian Empire, and extended his empire to include most of the known world. His con- quests extended as far east as Afghanistan and India, and as far west as Egypt. This led to the Hellenistic age, where Greek language and culture spread throughout the world. The word Hellenistic derives from ‚ÄúE  ‚Äù which means Greek. The city of Alexandra was founded by Alexander, and it became a major centre of learn- ing. Alexander the Great received tuition from the philosopher Aristotle. However, Alexander‚Äôs reign was very short as he died at the young age of 33 in 323 BC. Early Greek mathematics commenced approximately 500‚Äì600 BC with work done by Pythagoras and Thales. Pythagoras was a sixth century philosopher and mathematician who had spent time in Egypt becoming familiar with Egyptian math- ematics. He lived on the island of Samoa and formed a sect known as the Pythagore- ans. This Pythagoreans were a secret society and included men and women. They believed in the transmigration of souls and believed that number was the fundamen- tal building block for all things. They discovered the mathematics for harmony in music by discovering that the relationship between musical notes could be expressed in numerical ratios of small whole numbers. Pythagoras is credited with the dis- covery of Pythagoras‚Äôs Theorem, although this theorem was probably known by
