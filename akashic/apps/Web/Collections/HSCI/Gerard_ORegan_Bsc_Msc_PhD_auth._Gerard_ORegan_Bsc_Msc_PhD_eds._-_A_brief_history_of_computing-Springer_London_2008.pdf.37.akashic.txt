Babbage saw the operation of the Analytic Engine as analogous to the operation of the Jacquard loom.12 The latter is capable of weaving any design which may be conceived by man. A weaving company employs a team of skilled artists to design patterns for the loom, and the pattern is then executed by the loom. The pattern is designed by punching holes on a set of cards and the cards are ordered so that each card represents successive rows in the design. The cards are then placed in the Jacquard loom, and the exact pattern as designed by the artist is produced by the loom. Table 2.6 Analytic engine Part Function Store This contains the variables to be operated upon as well as all those quantities which have arisen from the result of intermediate operations. Mill The mill is essentially the processor of the machine into which the quantities about to be operated upon are brought. 11 The thirty one wheels allowed 31-digit numbers to be represented as each wheel could represent a decimal digit. 12 The Jacquard loom was invented by Joseph Jacquard in 1801. It is a mechanical loom which used the holes in punch cards to control the weaving of patterns in a fabric. The use of punched cards allowed complex designs to be woven from the pattern deﬁned on the punched card. Each punched card corresponds to one row of the design and the cards were appropriately ordered. It was very easy to change the pattern of the fabric being weaved on the loom, as this simply involved changing cards. 2.3 Babbage 43 The Jacquard loom was the ﬁrst machine to use punch cards to control a sequence of operations. The machine did not perform computation, but its ability to change the pattern of what was being weaved by changing cards gave Babbage the inspiration to use punched cards to store programs to perform the analysis and computation in the Analytic Engine. The use of the punched cards in the design of the Analytic Engine was extremely powerful, as it allowed the various formulae to be manipulated in a manner dic- tated by the programmer. The cards commanded the analytic engine to perform various operations and to return a result. Babbage distinguished between two types of punched cards: r Operation Cards r Variable Cards Operation cards are used to deﬁne the operations to be performed, whereas the vari- able cards deﬁne the variables or data that the operations are performed upon. This planned use of punched cards to store programs in the Analytic Engine is similar to the idea of a stored computer program in Von Neumann architecture. However, Bab- bage’s idea of using punched cards to represent machine instructions was over 100 years before Von Neumann’s architecture. Babbage’s Analytic Engine is therefore an important step in the history of computing. The Analytic Engine was designed by Babbage in 1834 [Bab:42], and was the design of the world’s ﬁrst mechanical computer. It included a processor, memory, and a way to input information and output results. However, the machine was never built during Babbage’s lifetime due to difﬁculty in achieving funding from the British Government. The government was not convinced that further funding should be given to start work on another machine given that his ﬁrst machine (i.e., the Difference Engine) had not been built. Babbage intended that the program be stored on read-only memory using punch cards, and that the input and output would be carried out using punch cards. He intended that the machine would store numbers and intermediate results in memory that could then be processed. There would be several punch card readers in the machine for programs and data, and that the machine should be able to perform conditional jumps. Babbage planned for parallel processing where several calcula- tions could be performed at once. Lady Ada (Fig. 2.8) was introduced into Babbage’s ideas on the analytic engine at a dinner party. She was a mathematician and the daughter of the poet Lord Byron. She was fascinated by the idea of the analytic engine and communicated regularly with Babbage on ideas on applications of the engine. She predicted that such a machine could be used to compose music, produce graphics, as well as solving mathematical and scientiﬁc problems. She suggested to Babbage that a plan be writ- ten for how the engine would calculate Bernoulli numbers. This plan is considered to be the ﬁrst computer program, and Lady Ada Lovelace is therefore considered the ﬁrst computer programmer. The Ada programming language developed in the United States is named in her honour. 44 2 Foundations Fig. 2.8 Lady Ada Lovelace Babbage died in 1871 and his brain was preserved in alcohol. His brain was then dissected over 30 years later in 1908 and is on view today in the science museum in London. 2.4 Formalism Gottlob Frege was a nineteenth century German mathematician and logician.
