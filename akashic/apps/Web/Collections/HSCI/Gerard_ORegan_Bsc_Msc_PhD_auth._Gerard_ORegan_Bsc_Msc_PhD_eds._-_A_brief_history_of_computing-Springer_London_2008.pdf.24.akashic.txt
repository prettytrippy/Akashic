mortal: i.e., a particular relationship between the two unrelated terms “Socrates” and “Mortal”. The example above is an example of a valid syllogistic argument. Aristotle studied the various possible syllogistic arguments and determined those that were valid and those that were invalid. There are several candidate relationships that may potentially exist between the terms in a premise. These include (Table 1.1): Table 1.1 Syllogisms: Relationship between terms Relationship Abbr. Universal Afﬁrmation A Universal Negation E Particular Afﬁrmation I Particular Negation O In general, a syllogistic argument will be of the form: S x M M y P . . . . . S z P where x, y, z may be universal afﬁrmation, universal negation, particular afﬁrmation and particular negation. Syllogistic logic is described in more detail in [ORg:06]. Aristotle’s work was highly regarded in classical and medieval times, and was believed to be a fully worked out system. Kant believed that there was nothing else to invent in Logic after the work of Aristotle. There was another competing system of logic proposed by the Stoics in Hellentistic times: i.e., an early form of propositional logic that was developed by Chrysippus19 in the third century BC. Later work in the nineteenth century by George Boole led to propositional logic, and later work by Frege and others led to predicate calculus. Aristotelian logic is mainly of historical interest today. The Greeks invented a number of mechanical devices to assist with problem solv- ing, and one of the most famous of these was the Antikythera [Pri:59]. This was an ancient mechanical device designed to calculate astronomical positions. An ancient Antikythera was discovered in 1902 in a week off the Greek island of Antikythera, and dates from about 80 BC. It is one of the oldest known geared devices, and it 19 Chrysippus was the head of the Stoics in the third century BC. 18 1 Early Civilisations is believed that it was used for calculating the position of the sun, moon, stars and planets for a particular date entered. The device is comparable in the complexity of its parts and gear arrangement as clocks in the eighteenth century. The Romans appear to have been aware of a device similar to the Antikythera, as a device that is capable of calculating the position of the planets is mentioned by Cicero. The island of Antikythera was well-known in the Greek and Roman period for its displays of mechanical engineering. A model of how the Antikythera might have worked is available, and according to that model, the front dial shows the annual progress of the Sun and Moon through the zodiac against the Egyptian calendar, with the other rear dials providing specialised information. It is debatable as to how accurate the model is with respect to the actual device. Other models proposed include that the device acted as a planetarium. 1.5 The Romans Rome is said to have been founded20 by Romulus and Remus about 750 BC. Early Rome covered a small part of Italy but it gradually expanded in size and importance. Rome destroyed Carthage21 in 146 BC to become the major power in the Mediterranean. Julius Caesar (Gaius Iulius Caesar) initially conquered the Gauls in 58 BC (Fig. 1.8). The Gauls consisted of several Celtic22 tribes who were disunited. Vercingetorix was the leader of the Arverni tribe and he succeeded brieﬂy in uniting the Celts. However, Caesar ﬁnally defeated Vercingetorix at the siege of Alesia in 52 BC. Roman merchants needed to develop accounting systems to track their trade across the Roman Empire. The Hellenistic world was colonized by the Romans,23 and the Romans became familiar with Greek culture and mathematics. The Romans introduced their own number system where Roman letters repre- sented numbers (Fig. 1.9): 20 The Aenid by Virgil suggests that the Romans were descended from survivors of the Trojan war, and that Aeneas brought surviving Trojans to Rome after the fall of Troy. 21 Carthage was located in Tunisia, and the wars between Rome and Carthage are known as the Punic wars. Hannibal was one of the great Carthaginan military commanders, and during the sec- ond Punic war, he brought his army to Spain, marched through Spain and crossed the Pyrenees. He then marched along southern France and crossed the Alps into Northern Italy. His army also consisted of war elephants. Rome ﬁnally defeated Carthage and levelled the city.
