come as a surprise that the use of base 60 was common in computation circa 1500 BC. One example of the use of base 60 today is still evident in the sub-division of hours into 60 minutes, and the sub-division of minutes into 60 seconds. The base 60 system (i.e. the sexagesimal system) is inherited from the Babylonians [Res:84], and the Babylonians were able to represent arbitrarily large numbers or fractions with just two symbols. Other bases that have been used in modern times include binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16). Binary and hexadecimal arithmetic play a key role in computing, as the machine instructions that computing machines understand are in binary code. The ancient societies considered in this chapter include the Babylonians, the Egyptians, and the Greek and Romans. These early civilizations were concerned with the solution of practical problems such as counting, basic book keeping, the construction of buildings, calendars and elementary astronomy. They used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as moving to a carbon neutral way of life. The solution to the environmental issues will be a major challenge for the twenty ﬁrst century. 1.1 Introduction 3 appropriate mathematics to assist them in computation. Early societies had no currency notes like U.S. Dollars or Euros, and trading between communities was conducted by bartering. This involved the exchange of goods for other goods at a negotiated barter rate between the parties. This required elementary computation as the bartering of one cow would require the ability to agree that a cow was worth so many of another animal, crop or good, e.g., sheep, corn, and so on. Once this bartering rate was agreed the two parties then needed to verify that the correct number of goods was received in exchange. Therefore, the ability to count was fundamental. The achievements of some of these ancient societies were spectacular. The archaeological remains of ancient Egypt are very impressive, and include the pyra- mids at Giza, the temples of Karnak near Luxor and Abu Simbal on the banks of Lake Nasser. These monuments provide an indication of the engineering sophis- tication of the ancient Egyptian civilisation. The objects found in the tomb of Tutankamun2 are now displayed in the Egyptian museum in Cairo, and demonstrate the artistic skill of the Egyptians. The Greeks made major contributions to western civilization including contribu- tions to Mathematics, Philosophy, Logic, Drama, Architecture, Biology and Democ- racy.3 The Greek philosophers considered fundamental questions such as ethics, the nature of being, how to live a good life, and the nature of justice and poli- tics. The Greek philosophers include Parmenides, Heraclitus, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. The works of Plato and Aristotle remain important in philosophy today, and are studied widely. The Greeks invented democracy and their democracy was radically different from today’s representative democracy.4 The sophistication of 2 Tutankamun was a minor Egyptian pharaoh who reigned after the controversial rule of Akenaten. Tutankamun’s tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in the valley of the kings, and the tomb was intact. The quality of the workmanship of the artefacts found in the tomb was extraordinary and a visit to the Egyptian museum in Cairo is memorable. 3 The origin of the word “democracy” is from demos (δμo) meaning people and kratos (αo) meaning rule. That is, it means rule by the people. It was introduced into Athens following the reforms introduced by Cleisthenes. He divided the Athenian city state into thirty areas. Twenty of these areas were inland or along the coast and ten were in Attica itself. Fishermen lived mainly in the ten coastal areas; farmers in the ten inland areas; and various tradesmen in Attica. Cleisthenes introduced ten new clans where the members of each clan came from one coastal area, one inland area on one area in Attica. He then introduced a Boule (or assembly) which consisted of 500 members (50 from each clan). Each clan ruled for 1/10th of the year. 4 The Athenian democracy involved the full participations of the citizens (i.e., the male adult mem- bers of the city state who were not slaves) whereas in representative democracy the citizens elect representatives to rule and represent their interests. The Athenian democracy was chaotic and could also be easily inﬂuenced by individuals who were skilled in rhetoric. There were teachers (known as the Sophists) who taught wealthy citizens rhetoric in return for a fee. The origin of the word “sophist” is the Greek word oo meaning wisdom. One of the most well known of the sophists was Protagorus, and Plato has a dialogue of this name. The problems with the Athenian democracy led philosophers such as Plato to consider alternate solutions such as rule by philosopher kings.
