could be no more than that of ﬂies or bats. He argued that since animals did not have minds (or souls), then this meant that they did not suffer, and that man is absolved from guilt in slaughtering and eating animals. However, if Descartes could not infer the existence of minds in animals from their behaviour, then how could he infer the existence of minds in other humans from their behavior? His analogy could just as easily be extended to man’s mind as to his body as God is capable of contriving both human and animal automata. The signiﬁcance of Descartes in the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence is that the Cartesian dualism that humans seem to possess would need to be reﬂected among artiﬁcial machines. Humans seem to have a distinct sense of “I” as distinct from the body, and the “I” seems to represent some core sense or essence of being that is unchanged throughout the person’s life. It somehow represents personhood, as distinct from the physical characteristics of a person that are inherited genetically. The challenge for the AI community in the longer term is to construct a machine 3 An automaton is a self-operating machine or mechanism that behaves and responds in a mechan- ical way. 5.3 The Field of Artiﬁcial Intelligence 155 that (in a sense) possesses Cartesian dualism. That is, the long-term4 goal of AI is to produce a machine that has awareness of itself as well as its environment. 5.3 The Field of Artiﬁcial Intelligence The foundations for Artiﬁcial Intelligence goes back to the foundations of comput- ing, and it includes the work of famous scientists, engineers and mathematicians. These include names such as Boole, Babbage, Shannon, von Neumann and Turing. There is an excellent account of the various disciplines in the AI ﬁeld, as well as key problems to be solved if the ﬁeld is to progress in [ONu:95]. Artiﬁcial Intelligence is a multi-disciplinary ﬁeld and its many branches include: r Computing r Logic and Philosophy r Psychology r Linguistics r Machine Vision r Computability r Epistemology and Knowledge representation The British mathematician, Alan Turing, contributed to the debate concerning thinking machines, consciousness and intelligence in the early 1950s [Tur:50]. He devised the famous “Turing Test” to judge whether a machine was conscious and intelligent. Turing’s paper was very inﬂuential as it raised the idea of the possibility of programming a computer to behave intelligently. Shannon considered the prob- lem of writing a chess program in the late 1940s, and distinguished between a brute force strategy where the program could look at every combination of moves or a strategy where knowledge of chess could be used to select and examine a subset of available moves. Turing also wrote programs for a computer to play chess, and the ability of a program to play chess is a skill that is considered intelligent, even though the machine itself is not conscious that it is playing chess. The early computer chess programs were not very sophisticated and performed poorly against humans. The modern chess programs have been quite successful, and have advantages over humans in terms of computational speed in considering combinations of moves. The chess grandmaster, Kasparov, was defeated by the IBM chess program “Deep Blue” in a six game match in 1997. The computer and Kas- parov were even going into the ﬁnal game which Kasparov lost. Kasparov asked for a re-match against Deep Blue, but IBM decided instead to retire the machine. Kasparov also played a 4-game match against the chess playing program X3D Fritz in 2003. The result of this match was a draw. 4 This long-term goal may be hundreds of years as there is unlikely to be an early breakthrough in machine intelligence as there are deep philosophical problems to be solved. It took the human species hundreds of thousands of years to evolve to its current levels of intelligence. 156 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems The origin of the term “Artiﬁcial Intelligence” is in work done on the proposal for Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artiﬁcial Intelligence. This proposal was written by John McCarthy (Fig. 5.2) and others in 1955, and the research project took place in the summer of 1956. Herbert A. Simon and Alan Newell did work in 1956 [NeS:56] on a program called “Logic Theorist” or “LT”. This program was the world’s ﬁrst theorem prover, and could independently provide proofs of various the- orems5 in Russell’s and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica [RuW:10]. The proof of a theorem requires creativity and intelligence, and the LT program demonstrated that
