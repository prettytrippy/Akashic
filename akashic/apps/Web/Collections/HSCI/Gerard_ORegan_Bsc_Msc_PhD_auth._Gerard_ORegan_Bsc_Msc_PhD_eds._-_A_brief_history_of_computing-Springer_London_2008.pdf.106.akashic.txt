a narrow domain. The long-term goal is to develop expert systems with a broader range of knowledge. Expert systems have enhanced productivity in business and engineering, and there are several commercial software packages available to assist. Some of the well-known expert systems that have been developed include Mycin, Colossus and Dendral. Mycin was developed at Stanford University in the 1970s, and it was developed from the original Dendral system. It was written in LISP and it was designed to diagnose infectious blood diseases, and to recommend appropriate antibiotics and dosage amounts corresponding to the patient’s body weight. Mycin had a knowledge base of approximately 500 rules and had a fairly simple inference engine. Its approach was to query the physician running the program with a long list of yes/no questions. Its output consisted of various possible bacteria that could correspond to the blood disease, along with an associated probability that indicated the conﬁdence in the diagnosis, and it also included the rationale for the diagnosis and a course of treatment appropriate to the diagnosis. Mycin’s performance was reasonable as it had a correct diagnosis rate of 65%. This was better than the diagnosis of most physicians who did not specialise in bacterial infections. However, its diagnosis rate was less than that of experts in bac- terial infections who had a success rate of 80%. Mycin was never actually used in practice due to legal and ethical reasons in the use of expert systems in medicine. For example, if the machine makes the wrong diagnosis who is to be held responsible? Colossus was an expert system used by several major Australian insurance com- panies. It helps insurance adjusters to assess personal injury claims, and helps to improve consistency in the claims process. It aims to make claims fair and objec- tive by guiding the adjuster through an objective evaluation of medical treatment options, the degree of pain and suffering of the claimant, and the extent that there is permanent impairment to the claimant, as well as the impact of the injury on the claimant’s lifestyle. It was developed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). Dendral (Dendritic Algorithm) was developed at Stanford University in the mid- 1960s, and it was the ﬁrst use of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in medical research. Its objec- tives were to assist the organic chemist with the problem of identifying unknown organic compounds and molecules by computerized spectrometry. This involved 176 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems the analysis of information from mass spectrometry graphs and knowledge of chem- istry. Dendral automated the decision-making and problem-solving process used by organic chemists to identify complex unknown organic molecules. It was written in LISP and it showed how an expert system could employ rules, heuristics and judgment to guide scientists in their work. 5.13 Review Questions 1.

The ultimate goal of Artiﬁcial Intelligence is to create a thinking machine that is intelligent, has consciousness, has the ability to learn, has free will, and is ethical. It is a multi- disciplinary ﬁeld, and its branches include: r Computing r Logic and Philosophy r Psychology r Linguistics r Machine Vision r Computability r Epistemology and Knowledge representation Turing believed that machine intelligence was achievable and he devised the famous “Turing Test” to judge whether a machine was conscious and intelligent. Searle’s Chinese Room argument is a rebuttal that aims to demonstrate that a machine will never have the same cognitive qualities as a human, and that even if a machine passes the Turing Test it still lacks intelligence and consciousness. McCarthy’s approach to Artiﬁcial Intelligence is to use logic to describe the man- ner in which intelligent machines or people behave. His philosophy is that common sense knowledge and reasoning can be formalised with logic. That is, human-level intelligence may be achieved with a logic-based system. 5.14 Summary 177 Cognitive psychology is concerned with cognition and some of its research areas include perception, memory, learning, thinking, and logic and problem solving. Lin- guistics is the scientiﬁc study of language and includes the study of syntax and semantics.
