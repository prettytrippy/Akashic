HP merged with Compaq in 2002, and the new company is known as HP. Today, HP has revenues of over $90 billion and employs over 150,000 people. The rise of HP and insight into its business practices, culture and management style that led to its success are described by David Packard in [Pac:96]. 7.9 Miscellaneous This section considers some miscellaneous technology companies including Philips, Amdahl and Sun Microsystems. 7.9.1 Amdahl Amdahl was founded by Gene Amdahl in 1970. Amdahl was a former IBM employee and had worked on the System 360 family of mainframe computers. The company launched its ﬁrst product in 1975, and this was the Amdahl 470. This prod- uct competed directly against the IBM System 370 family of mainframes. Amdahl became a major competitor to IBM in the high-end mainframe market, and Amdahl gained 24% market share. 232 7 Famous Technology Companies Amdahl worked closely with Fujitsu to improve circuit design, and Fujitsu’s inﬂuence on the company increased following Gene Amdahl’s departure from the company in 1980. Amdahl moved into large system multi-processor design from the mid-1980s. However, by the late-1990s it was clear that Amdahl could no longer effectively compete against IBM’s 64-bit zSeries as Amdahl had only 31-bit servers to sell. The company estimated that it would take $1 billion to create an IBM-compatible 64-bit system. Amdah became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu in 1997, and its headquar- ters are in California. 7.9.2 Philips Philips is a European technology giant and it was founded in Eindhoven, The Netherland in 1891. It was founded by Gerard Philips,15 and initially the company made carbon-ﬁlament lamps. Today, it is a technology giant and it employs over 120,000 people, and has sales of approximately $27 billion. Its headquarters moved to Amsterdam in the late 1990s. The company began manufacturing vacuum tubes and manufacturing radios in the 1920s. It introduced consumer products such as the electric razor in the 1930s, and introduced the compact cassette in the 1960s. By the mid-1960s it was produc- ing integrated circuits, and its semiconductor sector played a key role in its business. Philips introduced the laser disc player in the late 1970s and it introduced the com- pact disk in 1982. It introduced the DVD in the late 1990s. Philips sold off a majority stake of its semiconductor business to a consortium of private equity investors in 2005. The company has gone through a major process of change, and it plans to focus on health care, lifestyle and technology in the future. 7.9.3 Sun Microsystems Sun Microsystems was founded by four Stanford University graduates in 1982, and the company is a vendor of computers and software. Its headquarters are in Santa Clara in California. Sun’s products include computer servers and workstations based on its SPARC processors and Solaris operating system. The SPARC workstation was ﬁrst intro- duced in the late 1980s. It has developed innovative technologies such as the Java platform, and has contributed to the development of open systems and open source software. The Java technology plays a key role in the portability of software, and allows developers to write applications once to run on any computer. 15 Gerard Philips was a cousin of Karl Marx. 7.11 Summary 233 7.10 Review Questions 1.

The origin of IBM goes back to Hermann Hollerith’s work on tabulating machines. This machine was designed to tabulate the results of the 1890 census in the United States. Microsoft was founded in the mid-1970s and it has grown to become a major corporation. It has developed operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Motorola was founded as the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928. Its ini- tial business was in the production of radios for cars and it became a world leader in radio and telecommunications. Motorola produces mobile phones and base stations for the mobile telecommunications ﬁeld. Apple was founded in the mid-1970s. It has developed innovative technology
