engine to do its work to calculate the required tables. The only operation that the Difference Engine can perform is the addition of the value of column n + 1 to column n, and this results in a new value for column n. Col- umn N can only store a constant and column 1 displays the value of the calculation for the current iteration. The machine needs to be programmed prior to execution, and this is done by setting initial values to each of the columns. Column 1 is set to the value of the polynomial at the start of computation; column 2 is set to a value derived from the ﬁrst and higher derivatives of the polynomial for the same value of x. Each of the columns from 3 to N is set to a value derived from the n–1st and higher derivatives of the polynomial. The Schuetz’s difference engine was an implementation of Babbage’s design, and it is comprised of shafts, shelves and wheels. The scientist could set numbers on the wheels,8 and turn a crank to start the computation. Then, by reading down each shaft, he could ﬁnd the result of a calculation. The difference engine was able 8 Each wheel represented a decimal digit and each wheel consisted of 10 teeth to perform the decimal representation. 2.3 Babbage 39 to print out the answers to the computation. The decimal numbering system was employed, and there was also a carry mechanism. The difference engine is unable to perform multiplication or division, and is therefore unable to calculate the value of a polynomial directly. Instead, once the initial value of the polynomial and its derivatives are calculated for some value of x, the difference engine can calculate any number of nearby values using the method of ﬁnite differences. This method is used by numerical analysts, and the objective is to replace computational intensive tasks that involve multiplication or division by an equivalent computation that just involves addition or subtraction which is less computationally intensive. 2.3.2 Finite Differences A ﬁnite difference9 is a mathematical expression of the form f (x + h)– f (x). If a ﬁnite difference is divided by h, then the resulting expression is similar to a differ- ential quotient, except that it is discrete.  f = f (x + h)– f (x) ≈f ′(x) (when h is small) h h Finite differences may be applied to approximate derivatives and they are often used to ﬁnd numerical solution to differential equations. The ﬁnite difference may be considered to be an operator  that takes a function f as an argument and returns  f . By employing the Taylor series expansion it can be seen that  = ehD–1.10 Finite difference approximation to higher order derivatives may also be obtained. For example: f ′′(x) ≈f ′(x + h)– f ′(x) ≈f (x + 2h)–2 f (x + h) + f (x) = 2 f h h2 h2 That is, f n(x) ≈n f hn (when h is small) The method of ﬁnite differences plays a key role in the production of tables for the polynomial using the Difference Engine. Consider the quadratic polynomial p(x) = 2x2 + 3x + 1 and consider Table 2.4. 9 Finite differences may be further differentiated into forward ﬁnite differences ( f ), backward differences ( f ) and central ﬁnite differences δf . 10 D represents the derivative operator that maps a function f to its derivative f ′. Dn represents the operator that maps a function to its nth derivative. 40 2 Foundations Table 2.4 Finite differences x f (x) Diff. 1 Diff. 2 1 6 2 15 9 3 28 13 4 4 45 17 4 5 66 21 4 The 1st difference is computed by subtracting two adjacent entries in the column of f (x). For example, 15 −6 = 9; 28 −15 = 13; and so on. Similarly, the 2nd difference is given by subtracting two adjacent entries in the Difference ﬁrst column: e.g., 13 −9 = 4; 17 −13 = 4; and do on. The entries in the 2nd difference column are the constant 4. In fact, for any n-degree polynomial the entries in the n-difference column is always a constant. The Difference Engine performs the computation of the table in a similar man- ner, although the approach is essentially the reverse of the above. The key point to realise is that once you have the ﬁrst row of the table, that the rest of the table may
