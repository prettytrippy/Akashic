composed of many simple processing units which are connected into a network. Their computational power depends on working together (parallel processing) on any task, and there is no central processing unit following a logical sequence of rules. Computation is related to the dynamic process of node ﬁrings. This structure is much closer to the operation of the human brain, and leads to a computer that may be applied to a number of complex tasks. 5.12 Expert Systems An expert system is a computer system that contains the subject-speciﬁc knowledge of one or more human experts. These systems allow knowledge to be stored and intelligently retrieved. Expert Systems arose in Artiﬁcial Intelligence during the 25 The ﬁring of a neuron means that it sends off a new signal with a particular strength (or weight). 26 In fact, many computers today still have an underlying von Neumann architecture. However, there have been major advances in speed and size of the hardware since the 1940s. Computers consist of a Central Processing Unit which executes the software (set of rules), and any intelligence in the machine resides in the set of rules supplied by the programmer. 174 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems 1960s, and several commercial expert systems have been developed since then. An expert system is a program made up of a set of rules (or knowledge) supplied by the subject-matter experts about a speciﬁc class of problems. The success of the expert system is largely dependent on the quality of the rules provided by the expert. The expert system also provides a problem solving component that allows analysis of the problem to take place, as well as recommending an appropriate course of action to solve the problem. That is, the expert system employs a reasoning capability to draw conclusions from facts that it knows, and it also recommends an appropriate course of action to the user. Expert Systems have been a major success story in the AI ﬁeld. They have been employed in various areas such as for diagnostics in the medical ﬁeld, equipment repair, and investment analysis. There is a clear separation between the collection of knowledge and the problem solving strategy of the system. Expert systems consist of the following components (Table 5.3): Table 5.3 Expert systems Component Description Knowledge Base The knowledge base is composed by experts in a particular ﬁeld, and the expert system is only as good as the knowledge provided by the experts. Communication Components This component (typically a user interface) allows the user to communicate with the expert system. It allows the user to pose questions to the system and to receive answers (or vice versa). Context Sensitive Help This is usually provided on all screens and the help provided is appropriate to where the user is in the system. Problem Solving Component The problem solving component analyses the problem and uses its inference engine to deduce the appropriate course of action to resolve the problem. The inference engine is software that interacts with the user and the rules in the knowledge base to produce an appropriate solution. Expertise consists of knowledge about a particular domain and involves under- standing problems in the domain as well as skill at solving these problems. Human knowledge of a specialty is of two types: namely public knowledge and private knowledge. The former includes the facts and theories documented in text books and publications on the domain, whereas the latter refers to knowledge that the expert possesses that has not found its way into the public domain. The latter often consists of rules of thumb or heuristics that allow the expert to make an educated guess where required, as well as allowing the expert to deal effectively with incomplete or erroneous data. The challenge for the AI ﬁeld is to allow the representation of both public and private knowledge to enable the expert system to draw valid inferences. The inference engine is made up of many inference rules that are used by the engine to draw conclusions. Rules may be added or deleted without affecting other 5.12 Expert Systems 175 rules, and this reﬂects the normal updating of human knowledge. That is, out-dated facts are, in effect, deleted and are no longer used in reasoning, while new knowl- edge is applied in drawing conclusions. The inference rules use reasoning which is closer to human reasoning. There are two main types of reasoning with inference rules and these are backward chaining and forward chaining. Forward chaining starts with the data available, and uses the inference rules to draw intermediate conclu- sions until a desired goal is reached. Backward chaining starts with a set of goals and works backwards to determine if one of the goals can be met with the data that is available. The expert system makes its expertise available to decision makers who need answers quickly. This is extremely useful as often there is a shortage of experts, and the availability of an expert computer with in-depth knowledge of speciﬁc subjects is therefore very attractive. Expert systems may also assist managers with long-term planning. There are many small expert systems available that are quite effective in
