Motorola was the prime contractor for Iridium, and it played a key role in the design and development of the system. The satellites were produced at an incredibly low cost of $5 million each ($40 million each including launch costs). The ﬁrst Iridium call was made by Al Gore. However, Iridium as a company failed and it went into bankruptcy protection in late 1999 due to: r insufﬁcient demand for its services r High cost of its service r Cost of its mobile handsets r Bulky mobile handsets r Competition from the terrestrial mobile phone networks r Management failures. However, the Iridium satellites remained in orbit, and the service was re-established in 2001 by the newly founded Iridium Satellite LLC. It is used extensively by the US Department of Defence. 7.5 Apple Computers Apple was founded by Steven Wozniak and Steven Jobs (Fig.7.10) in 1976. Jobs and Wozniak were two college dropouts, and they released the Apple I computer in 1977. It retailed for $666.66. They then proceeded to develop the Apple II computer. This machine included colour graphics and it came in its own plastic casing. It retailed for $1299 and it was one of the ﬁrst computers to come pre-assembled. The Apple II was a commercial success and Apple became a public listed company in 1980. The Apple Macintosh was released in 1984 and this machine was quite different from the IBM PC in that it included a graphical user interface that was friendly and intuitive. This made the Macintosh a much easier computer to use than the standard IBM PC, as the latter required users to be familiar with its DOS operating system and commands. The introduction of the Mac GUI was an important milestone in the computing ﬁeld. Jobs got the idea of the graphical user interface for the Macintosh from Xerox’s PARC research centre in Palo Alto in California. Apple intended that the Macintosh would be an inexpensive and user friendly personal computer that would rival the IBM PC and its clones. However, it was more expensive than its rivals as it retailed for $2,495, and initially the Macintosh had limited applications available. The IBM PC had spreadsheets, word processors and databases applications available. Apple went through ﬁnancial difﬁculty in the mid-1980s as its products were more expensive than rival offerings. Jobs resigned from the company in 1985, and he founded a new company called Next Inc. Microsoft and Apple signed a contract in the mid-1980s that granted Microsoft permission to use some of the Macintosh GUIs. This contract would lead to Apple losing all of the lawsuits over copyright 7.5 Apple Computers 227 Fig. 7.10 Steve Jobs Photo courtesy of Wikipedia. infringement against Microsoft that it took in later years. Apple Computers was sued by the Apple Corporation11 in 1989 for violating the terms of their 1981 agreement that prohibited Apple Computers from building computers with the capability of producing synthesized music. Apple released the Newton Message Personal Digital Assistant (PAD) in 1993. However, the Newton proved to be unsuccessful mainly due to reliability problems. IBM, Apple and Motorola entered an alliance in the early 1990s aimed at challeng- ing the Windows and Intel architecture. The responsibilities of IBM and Motorola were to design and produce the new Power CPUs for the new desktop computers 11 This was the Beatles recording company. 228 7 Famous Technology Companies and servers. The responsibilities of Apple were to port its MacOS operating system to the new architecture. The ﬁrst Power PC processor was released by Motorola in 1993, and Apple released its power Macintosh desktop computer in 1994 based on the Motorola pro- cessors. Motorola developed processors with enhanced capabilities in the coming years, and this led to better and faster Power Macintosh computers. These include the Power Macintosh and PowerBook G3, G4 and G5. Apple took over Next Inc. in 1996, and this led to a return of Jobs to Apple. Jobs became the acting head of Apple in 1997 and he developed an alliance between Apple and Microsoft. The iMac was released in 1998 and this was a major commercial success. Apple released the iBook in 1999 and this was another major commercial success. Apple released the iPod in 2001. This was a portable hard-disk MP3 player, and it had a capacity of 5 GB. The iPod could hold up to 1,000 MP3 songs. Apple released a software package (iTunes) that allowed MP3 ﬁles to be transferred from the Mac
