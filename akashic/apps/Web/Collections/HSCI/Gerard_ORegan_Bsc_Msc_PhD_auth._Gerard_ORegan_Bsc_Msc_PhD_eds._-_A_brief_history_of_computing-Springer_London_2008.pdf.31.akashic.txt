are either sheep or goats. He showed that these symbols obeyed a rich collection of algebraic laws and could be added, multiplied, etc., in a manner that is similar to real numbers. Boole showed how these symbols could be used to reduce propositions to equations, and algebraic rules could be used to solve the equations. The algebraic rules satisﬁed by his system included: 1. x + 0 = x (Additive Identity) 2. x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z (Associativity) 3. x + y = y + x (Commutativity) 4. x + (1–x) = 1 (Not operator) 5. x1 = x (Multiplicative Identity) 6. x0 = 0 7. x + 1 = 1 8. xy = yx (Commutativity) 9. x(yz) = (xy)z (Associativity) 10. x(y + z) = xy + xz (Distributive) 11. x(y–z) = xy–xz (Distributive) 12. x2 = x (Idempotent) 13. xn = x These operations are similar to the modern laws of set theory with the set union operation represented by “+”, and this is the “or” operation in modern Boolean algebra. The set intersection operation is represented by multiplication, and this is the “and” operation in Boolean Algebra. The universal set is represented by “1” is denoted by U in modern set theory, and the empty set “0” is denoted by ∅. The laws of associativity and distribution hold. Finally, the set complement operation is given by (1 −x), and this is the “not” operation of Boolean Algebra. Boole applied the symbols to encode propositions of Aristotle’s Syllogistic Logic, and he showed how the propositions could be reduced to the form of equa- tions. These equations allowed conclusions to be derived from premises by elimi- nating the middle term in the syllogism. Syllogistic logic had been in use for over 2000 years, and was the main form of logic employed in the nineteenth century. It remains of historical interest today as it has largely been replaced by predicate logic. Boole reﬁned his ideas further in his book “An Investigation of the Laws of Thought” [Boo:58] published in 1854. This book and his earlier paper on logic contain the concepts which have come to be known collectively as Boolean alge- bra. His book aimed to identify the fundamental laws underlying reasoning in the human mind, and to give expression to these laws in the symbolic language of a calculus. Boole considered the equation x2 = x to be one of the fundamental laws of though. It allows the principle of contradiction (i.e., that it is impossible for a being to possess an attribute and at the same time not to possess it) to be derived from this fundamental law of thought. 32 2 Foundations x2 = x ⇒x −x2 = 0 ⇒x(1 −x) = 0 For example, if x represents the class of horses then (1 −x) represents the class of “not-horses”. The product of two classes represents a class whose members are common to both classes. Hence, x(1 −x) represents the class whose members are at once both horses and “not-horses”, and the equation x(1 −x) = 0 expresses that fact that there is no such class whose members are both horses and “not-horses”. That is, there are no members of such a class and it is the empty set. Boole made contributions to other areas apart from logic. He published papers on differential equations and on ﬁnite differences.4 He also published a book on differential equations which was used as a text-book at Cambridge University in England. He also contributed to the development of probability theory. Boole married Mary Everest in 1855 and they lived in Lichﬁeld Cottage in Ballintemple, Cork. She was a niece of the surveyor of India, Sir George Everest, after whom the world’s highest mountain5 in the Himalayas is named. The Booles had ﬁve daughters, and one of their daughters was the author of the “The Gadﬂy”.6 Boole died prematurely (at the early age of 49) from pneumonia in 1864. He got soaked while walking two miles in the rain from his home in Ballintemple to teach his class at Queens University, Cork. He is buried in the graveyard of St. Michaels Church in Blackrock, Cork. Queens University Cork honoured his memory by installing a stained glass win- dow in the Aula Maxima of the college. This shows Boole writing at a table with
