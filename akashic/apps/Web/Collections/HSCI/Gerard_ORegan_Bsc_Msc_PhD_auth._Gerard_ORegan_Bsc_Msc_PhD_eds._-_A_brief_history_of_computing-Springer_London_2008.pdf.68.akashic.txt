laws c. 1750 BC. known as the Hammarabi Code. This code included the law that if a house collapsed and killed the owner then the builder of the house would be executed. 9 However, it is unlikely that an individual programmer would be subject to litigation in the case of a ﬂaw in a program causing damage or loss of life. Most software products are accompanied by a comprehensive disclaimer of responsibility for problems rather than a guarantee of quality. Software engineering is a team-based activity involving many engineers in various parts of the project, and it could be potentially difﬁcult for an outside party to prove that the cause of a particular problem is due to the professional negligence of a particular software engineer, as there are many others involved in the process such as reviewers of documentation and code and the various test groups. Companies are more likely to be subject to litigation, as a company is legally responsible for the actions of their employees in the workplace, and the fact that a company is a ﬁnancially richer entity than one of its employees. However, the legal aspects of licensing software may protect software companies from litigation including those companies that seem to place little emphasis on software quality. However, greater legal protection for the customer can be built into the contract between the supplier and the customer for bespoke-software development. 4.2 What Is Software Engineering? 109 The licensing of a professional engineer provides conﬁdence that the engineer has the right education and experience to build safe and reliable products.10 Other- wise, the profession gets a bad name as a result of poor work carried out by unqual- iﬁed people. Professional engineers are required to follow rules of good practice, and to object when the rules are violated.11 The licensing of an engineer requires that the engineer completes an accepted engineering course and understands their responsibilities. The professional body is responsible for enforcing standards and certiﬁcation. The term “engineer” is a title that is awarded on merit, but it also places responsibilities on its holder. Engineers have a professional responsibility and are required to behave ethically with their clients. The membership of the professional engineering body requires the member to adhere to the code of ethics of the profession. The code of ethics12 will detail the ethical behaviour and responsibilities (Table 4.1). The approach used in current software engineering is to follow a well-deﬁned software engineering process. The process includes activities such as project man- agement, requirements gathering, requirements speciﬁcation, architecture design, software design, coding, and testing. Most companies use a set of templates for the various phases. The waterfall model [Roy:70] and spiral model [Boe:88] are popular software development lifecycles. The waterfall model (Fig. 4.3) starts with requirements, followed by speciﬁca- tion, design, implementation, and testing. It is typically used for projects where the requirements can be identiﬁed early in the project lifecycle or are known in advance. The waterfall model is also called the “V” life cycle model, with the left-hand side of the “V” detailing requirements, speciﬁcation, design, and coding and the right- hand side detailing unit tests, integration tests, system tests and acceptance testing.

Continuous learning to ensure appropriate knowledge to serve the client effectively. 10 Companies that are following the CMMI framework generally employ a highly rigorous process for supplier selection. The formal evaluation of the supplier determines the technical knowledge of the candidate suppliers as well as their software process maturity and capability. The evaluation will generally take into account the qualiﬁcations and experience of the technical team that will be carrying out the work. 11 Software companies that are following the CMMI or ISO 9000 will employ audits to verify that the rules have been followed. Auditors report their ﬁndings to management and the ﬁndings are addressed appropriately by the project team and affected individuals. 12 My experience of working in software companies is that these are core values of most mature software companies. Larger companies have a code of ethics that employees are required to adhere as larger corporate companies will wish to project a good corporate image and to be respected world-wide. 110 4 Software Engineering Fig. 4.3 Waterfall lifecycle model (V-Model) Specification Requirements  Integration Testing Acceptance Testing System Testing  Design Code Unit Testing  Each phase has entry and exit criteria which must be satisﬁed before the next phase commences. There are many variations to the waterfall model. The spiral model (Fig. 4.4) is another lifecycle model, and is useful where the requirements are not fully known at project initiation. There is an evolution of the requirements as a part of the development lifecycle. The development proceeds in a
