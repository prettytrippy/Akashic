is overloaded by a malicious attack, and where users are therefore unable to access the web site for an extended period of time. The display of web pages on the local client machine may involve the download- ing of programs from the server, and running the program on the client machine (e.g., Java Applets). Standard HTML allows the static presentation of a web page, whereas many web pages include active content (e.g., Java Applets or Active X). There is a danger that a Trojan horse4 may be activated during the execution of active content. Security threats may be from anywhere (e.g., client side, server side, transmis- sion) in an e-commerce environment, and therefore a holistic approach to security is required. Internal and external security measures need to be considered. Internal security is generally implemented via procedures and access privileges. It is essential that the user is conﬁdent in the security provided as otherwise they will be reluctant to pass credit card details over the web for purchases. This has led to technologies such as secure-socket layer (SSL) and secure HTTP (S- HTTP) to ensure security. Another approach is the use of e-cash for electronic payments. 4 The origin of the term “Trojan Horse” is from the approach used by the Greeks to capture the city of Troy. The Greek hero Odysseus and others hid in a wooden horse while the other Greeks sailed away from Troy. This led the Trojans to believe that the Greeks had abandoned their attack and were returning to their homeland leading behind a farewell gift for the citizens of Troy. The Trojans brought the wooden horse into the city and later that night Odysseus and his companions opened the gates of Troy to the returning Greeks, and the mass slaughter of the citizens of Troy commenced. Troy is located at the mouth of the Dardanelles in Turkey. 6.11 Summary 201 6.10 Review Questions 1. Describe the development of the internet. 2.

It has transformed the internet from mainly academic use (with limited commercial involvement) to the world of electronic commerce where the use of the internet and world-wide web is an integral part of peoples’ lives. The growth of the world-wide web has been phenomenal since its invention in 1991. New companies were formed to exploit the commercial opportunities of the web, and existing companies developed e-business and e-commerce strategies. Companies providing full e-commerce solutions were concerned with the selling of products or services over the web to either businesses or consumers. The world-wide web is revolutionary in that: r No single organization controls the web. r No single computer controls the web. r Millions of computers are interconnected. r It is an enormous market place of millions (billions) of users. r The web is not located in one physical location. r The web is a space and not a physical thing. The growth of the world-wide web was exponential, and the boom led to the for- mation of many “new economy” businesses. The key characteristic of these new businesses was that business was largely conducted over the web as distinct from the “old economy” bricks and mortar companies. Some of these companies were very successful and remain in business. Others were ﬁnancial disasters due to poor business models, poor management and poor implementation of the new technology. Chapter 7 Famous Technology Companies Key Topics Hollerith’s Tabulating Machine IBM 360 IBM Personal Computer Microsoft Motorola Six Sigma 7.1 Introduction This chapter considers the history of some well known technology companies. These include International Business Machines (IBM), Microsoft and Motorola. The origin of IBM goes back to the late nineteenth century with Hermann Hol- lerith’s work on tabulating machines. This machine was designed to tabulate the results of the 1890 census in the United States. IBM has grown to become a major corporation and it has made a major contribution to the computing ﬁeld. It is a world class professional company and is dedicated to quality and customer satisfaction. Microsoft was founded in the mid-1970s and it was awarded a contract by IBM to develop the Disk Operating System (DOS) for the IBM PC. It has grown to become a major corporation and has developed operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Motorola was founded as the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928. Its
