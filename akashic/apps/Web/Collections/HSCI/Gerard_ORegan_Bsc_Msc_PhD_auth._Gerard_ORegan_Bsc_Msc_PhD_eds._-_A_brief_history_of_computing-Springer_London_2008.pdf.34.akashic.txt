Charles Babbage (Fig. 2.6) is considered (along with George Boole) to be one of the fathers of computing. He was born in Devonshire, England in 1791 and was the son of a banker. He studied Mathematics at Cambridge University in England and was appointed to the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge in 1828. He was a profound thinker and make contributions in several areas including mathe- matics, statistics, astronomy, philosophy, railways and lighthouses. He founded the British Statistical society and the Royal Astronomical Society. His pioneering work in computing remains well-known today. Babbage was interested in mathematical tables but recognised that there was a high error rate in the tables due to the human error introduced during their calcula- tion. He was interested in solving this problem, and his approach was to investigate a method by which the calculation of tables could be done mechanically. This would thereby eliminate the errors introduced by humans in their computation. There had been some experimental work done on calculating machines by Pascal and Leibnitz, and Babbage became interested in designing a calculating machine from the early 1820s. He designed the Difference Engine (No. 1) in 1821 and this was a special purpose machine for the production of mathematical tables. A difference engine is essen- tially a mechanical calculator (analogous to modern electronic calculators), and it 2.3 Babbage 37 Fig. 2.6 Charles Babbage was designed to compute polynomial functions. It could also compute logarithmic and trigonometric functions such as sine or cosine, as these may be approximated by polynomials.7 The accurate approximation of trigometric, exponential and logarith- mic functions by polynomials depends on the degree of the polynomials, the number of decimal digits that it is being approximated to, and the error function. A higher degree polynomial is able to approximate the function more accurately than a lower degree polynomial. Accurate trigometric tables were essential for navigation, and the Difference Engine offered the potential for accurate computation by polynomial approximations. Babbage produced prototypes for parts of the Difference Engine but he never actually completed the engine. The Difference Engine envisaged by 7 The power series expansion of the Sine function is given by sin(x) = x–x3/3!+x5/5!–x7/7!+. . . The power series expansion for the Cosine function is given by cos(x) = 1–x2/2!+x4/4!–x6/6!+ . . . Functions may be approximated by interpolation and the approximation of a function by a polynomial of degree n requires n + 1 points on the curve for the interpolation. That is, the curve formed by the polynomial of degree n that passes through the n + 1 points on the function to be approximated is an approximation to the function. 38 2 Foundations Babbage was intended to operate on 6th order polynomials of 20 digits. A polyno- mial of degree 6 is of the form p(x) = ax6 + bx5 + cx4 + dx3 + ex2 + fx + g. 2.3.1 Difference Engine The ﬁrst working difference engine was built in 1853 by the Swedish engineers George and Edward Schuetz. The Schuetz brothers based their plans on Babbage’s design, and received funding from the Swedish government to build the machine. The Schuetz machine could compute polynomials of degree 4 on 15-digit numbers. A copy of the 3rd Scheutz Difference Engine is on display in the Science Museum in London. This machine was the ﬁrst to compute and print mathematical tables mechani- cally. Today, the computation of mathematical tables is done by electronic comput- ers. However, in the nineteenth century this task was performed manually and it was error prone. The working engine produced by the Schuetz brothers was accurate, and it was used by scientists and engineers to perform their calculations. Babbage’s Difference Engine showed the potential of mechanical machines as a tool for scien- tists and engineers. Today, the availability of modern electronic calculators means that students no longer need to concern themselves with the production of tables. The difference engine consists of a number of columns (1 to N). Each column is able to store one decimal number, and the numbers are represented by wheels. The Difference Engine (No. 1) has seven columns with each column containing 20 wheels. Each wheel consists of ten teeth and these represent the decimal digits. Each column could therefore represent a decimal number with up to 20 digits. The seven columns allowed the representation of polynomials of degree six. The engine could store only seven decimal numbers at any one time, and a Difference Engine with N columns may store N numbers at any one time. Surprisingly, this is sufﬁcient for the
