roll costs. Further, a large number of products were returned by purchasers, and there was no postage charge applied for this service. However, the company incurred a signiﬁcant cost for covering postage for returns. Eventually, the company went bankrupt in 2000. A description of the formation and collapse of the company is available in the book Boo Hoo [MaP:02]. This book is a software development horror story, and the maturity of the software development practices in place at the company may be judged by the fact that while it had up to 18 contractor companies working to develop the web-site the developers were working without any source code control mechanism in place. The latter is basic software engineering. Pets.com was an on-line pet supply company founded in 1998 by Greg McLemore. It sold pet accessories and supplies. It had a well-known advertisement as to why one should shop at an online pet store. The answer to this question was: “Because Pets Can’t Drive!”. Its mascot (the Pets.com sock puppet) was also well known. It launched its IPO in February 2000 just before the dot com collapse. Pets.com made investments in infrastructure such as warehousing and vehicles. However, in order to break even the company needed a critical mass of customers. The company’s management believed that the company needed $300 million of revenue to breakeven, and that this would take a minimum of four to ﬁve years to achieve. This time period was based on growth of internet shopping and the percent- age of pet owners that shopped on the Internet. By late 2000, the company realised that it would be unable to raise further capital due to the negative sentiment with technology ﬁrms following the dot com collapse. They tried to sell the company without success. The company went into liquidation at the end of November 2000 (just nine months after the IPO). However, it did return 17 cents in the dollar to its shareholders. Kozmo.com was an online company that promised free one-hour delivery of small consumer goods. It was founded by Joseph Park and Yong Kang in New York in 1998. The point-to-point delivery was usually done by bicycle messengers, and no delivery fee was charged. However, the business model was deeply ﬂawed, as the point to point delivery of small goods within a 1-hour period is extremely expensive. There was no way that the company could make a proﬁt unless it charged delivery fees. The company argued that they could make savings to offset the delivery costs as they did not require retail space. The company expanded into several cities in the United States, and raised about $280 million from investors. It had planned to launch an IPO but due to the dot com bubble this was abandoned. The company shut down in 2001. 6.7.2 Business Models A company requires a sound business model to be successful. A business model converts a technology idea or innovation into a commercial reality, and needs to 194 6 The Internet Revolution be appropriate for the company and the market that the company is operating in. A company needs a lot more than a good idea or invention to be successful. A company with an excellent business idea but with a weak business model may fail, whereas a company with an average business idea but an excellent business model may be quite successful. Many of the business models in the dot com era were deeply ﬂawed, and the eventual collapse of many of these companies was predictable. Chesbrough and Rosenbroom [ChR:02] have identiﬁed six key components in a business model (Table 6.4): Table 6.4 Characteristics of business models Constituent Description Value Proposition This describes how the product or service that the company provides is a solution to a customer problem.
