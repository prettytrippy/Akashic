22 The Celtic period commenced around 1000 BC in Hallstaat (near Salzburg in Austria). The Celts were skilled in working with Iron and Bronze, and they gradually expanded into Europe. They eventually reached Britain and Ireland around 600 BC. The early Celtic period was known as the “Hallstaat period” and the later Celtic period is known as “La T´ene”. The later La T´ene period is characterised by the quality of ornamentation produced. The Celtic museum in Hallein in Austria provides valuable information and artefacts on the Celtic period. The Celtic language would have similarities to the Irish language. However, the Celts did not employ writing, and the Ogham writing developed in Ireland was employed later in the early Christian period. 23 The Romans did not make any major advances on Hellenistic Mathematics. 1.5 The Romans 19 Fig. 1.8 Julius Caesar Fig. 1.9 Roman numbers I = 1 V = 5 X = 10 L = 50 C = 100 D = 500 M = 1000 A Roman number consists of a sequence of Roman letters and there were rules employed in the evaluation. The rules speciﬁed that if a number follows a smaller number then the smaller number is subtracted from the large: e.g., IX represents 9 and XL represents 40. Similarly, if a smaller number followed a larger number they were generally added: e.g., MCC represents 1200. They had no zero in their system. Roman numerals are still used today in page numbering for books or on the faces of clocks. 20 1 Early Civilisations Calculations with Roman numerals was cumbersome, especially operations that involved multiplication or division. In practice, an abacus was often employed to perform the calculation. An abacus consists of several columns in which pebbles are placed. Each column represented powers of 10: i.e., 100, 101, 102, 103, etc. The column to the far right represents one; the column to the left 10; next column to the left 100; and so on. Pebbles (calculi) were placed in the columns to represent different numbers: e.g., the number represented by an abacus with 4 pebbles on the far right; 2 pebbles in the column to the left; and 3 pebbles in the next column to the left is 324. Calculations were performed by moving pebbles from column to column. The operator of the abacus needed to be properly trained to be effective. The Roman merchant needed to perform calculations to keep track of trade within the Roman Empire. They introduced a set of weights and measures (includ- ing the libra for weights and the pes for lengths). The merchants also developed an early banking system to provide loans for business. They commenced minting money about 290 BC. The Romans also made contributions to calendars and the Julian calendar was introduced in 45 BC by Julius Caesar. It has a regular year of 365 days divided into 12 months and a leap day is added to February every four years. It remained in use up to the twentieth century, but has since been replaced by the Gregorian calendar. The problem with the Julian calendar is that too many leap years are added over time. The Gregorian calendar was ﬁrst introduced in 1582. The Romans employed the available mathematics that had been developed by the Greeks. Caesar’s Cipher was employed by Caesar on his military campaigns in order to safely communicate important messages to his generals. It is one of the simplest and widely known encryption techniques, and involves the substitution of each letter in the plaintext (i.e., the original message) by a letter a ﬁxed number of positions down in the alphabet. For example, a shift of 3 positions cause the letter B to be replaced by E, the letter C by F, and so on. The Caesar cipher is easily broken, as the frequency distribution of letters may be employed to determine the mapping. However, given that Caesar was essentially dealing with Gaulish tribes who were mainly illiterate, and who certainly lacked knowledge of cryptology and frequency distribution of the letters in the alphabet, it is likely to have provided good security. The translation of the Roman letters by the Caesar cipher (with a shift key of 3) can be seen by the following table. It shows each letter of the alphabet and the corresponding cipher symbol that it is mapped on to (Table 1.2): Table 1.2 Caesar cipher Alphabet Symbol abcde fghij klmno pqrst uvwxyz Cipher Symbol dfegh ijklm nopqr stuvw xyzabc The process of enciphering a message (i.e., plaintext) simply involves looking up each letter in the plaintext and writing down the corresponding cipher letter. For example, the enciphering of the plaintext message “summer solstice” involves the following:
