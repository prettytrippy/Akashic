The memory of the machine consisted of 32 32-bit words, and it took 1.2 milliseconds to execute one instruction: i.e., 0.00083 MIPS. This is very slow compared to today’s computers which are rated at speeds of up to 1000 MIPs. The team in Manchester developed the machine further, and in 1949, the Manchester Mark 1 (Fig. 2.27) was available.

Their ﬁrst machine was called the Ferranti Mark 1, and it was released in 1951. There is more emphasis today on architectures that are free from the constraints of the traditional von Neumann architecture. The goals are to have an architecture that will increase productivity, and in recent years a number of computers have claimed to be “non-von Neumann”. This trend is likely to continue as new architec- tures evolve, and where both hardware and software are freed from the limitations of the von Neumann architecture. The limitations include: r Limited to sequential processing r Not very well suited to parallel processing (multiple data/instructions) 2.8 Konrad Zuse Konrad Zuse (Fig. 2.28) was a German engineer who was born in Bonn in 1910. He worked initially as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in east- ern Germany, but resigned from his job after about a year to commence work on building a program driven and programmable machine at his parents’ apartment. He produced his ﬁrst machine called the Z1 in 1936, and this machine was a binary elec- trically driven mechanical calculator with limited programmability. The machine was capable of executing instructions read from the program punch cards only, but the program itself was never loaded into the memory. The machine was essentially a 22-bit ﬂoating point value adder and subtracter. The input to the machine was done with a decimal keyboard and the output was dec- imal digits. The machine included some control logic which allowed it to perform more complex operations such as multiplications and division. These operations were performed by repeated additions for multiplication, and repeated subtractions for division. Multiplication took approximately 5 seconds. The computer memory contained 64 22-bit words. Each word of memory could be read from and written to by the program punch cards and the control unit. It had a clock speed of 1 Hz, and two ﬂoating point registers of 22 bits each. The machine itself was unreliable and a reconstruction of it is in the Deutch Technikmuseum in Berlin. His next attempt was the creation of the Z2 machine. This was a mechanical and relay computer created in 1939 and it aimed to improve on the Z1. It used a similar mechanical memory but replaced the arithmetic and control logic with electrical relay circuits. It used 16-bit ﬁxed point arithmetics instead of the 22-bit used in the Z1. It had 32 bytes of memory (16 words of 16 bits) and had a clock speed of 3 Hz. His greatest achievement was the completion of the ﬁrst functional tape-stored- program-controlled computer, the Z3, in 1941. The Z3 was proven to be Turing- complete in 1998. It was only discovered in the aftermath of world-war two that 70 2 Foundations Fig. 2.28 Konrad Zuse Courtesy of Horst Zuse, Berlin. a program controlled computer called the Z3 had been completed in Germany in 1941. It pre-dates the Harvard Mark I21 and the Manchester Mark 1. The Z3 was very sophisticated for its time and it was based on relays. It used the binary number system and could perform ﬂoating-point arithmetic. It had a clock speed of 5Hz and multiplication and division took 3 seconds. The input to the machine was with a decimal keyboard and the output was on lamps that could display decimal numbers. The word length was 22-bits. There is a reconstruction of the Z3 computer in the Deutch Museum in Munich. Zuse also developed the Plankalk¨ul high-level programming language in 1946.
