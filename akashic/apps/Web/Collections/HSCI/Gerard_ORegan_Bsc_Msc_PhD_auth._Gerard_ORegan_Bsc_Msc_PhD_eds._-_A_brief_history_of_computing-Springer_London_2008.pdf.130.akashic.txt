dard for analog cellular phone service. It used the 800 MHz cellular band, and it was used in the United States and other countries. It had a frequency range between 800 and 900 MHz. These frequencies were allocated by the Federal Communica- tions Commission (FCC). Each service provider could use half of the 824–849MHz range for receiving signals from cellular phones and half the 869–894MHz range for transmitting to cellular phones. The bands are divided into 30 kHz sub-bands called channels. The division of the spectrum into sub-band channels is achieved by using frequency division multiple access (FDMA). The signals from a transmitter cover an area called a cell. As a user moves from one cell into a new cell a handover to the new cell takes place without any noticeable transition. The signals in the adjacent cell are sent and received on different channels than the previous cell’s signals and so there is no interference. Analog is the original mobile phone system but has been replaced by more sophisticated systems in recent years. These include GSM, CDMA, GPRS and UMTS. The old analog phones were susceptible to noise and static. They were also subject to eavesdropping. Bell Labs constructed and operated a prototype cellular system in Chicago in the late 1970s and performed public trials in Chicago in 1979. Motorola commenced a second US cellular radio-phone system test in the Washington/Baltimore area. The ﬁrst commercial systems commenced operation in the United States in 1983. Motorola dominated the analog mobile phone market. However, it was slow to adapt to the GSM standard and it paid the price in loss of market share to Nokia and other competitors. The company was very slow to see the potential of a mobile phone as a fashion device.10 However, in recent years the company has made painful 10 The attitude of Motorola at the time seemed to be similar to that of Henry Ford: i.e., they can have whatever colour they like as long as it is black. 7.4 Motorola 225 adjustments to position itself appropriately for the future. The company decided to focus on mobile phone technology and has sold off non-core businesses including its automotive and semi-conductor businesses. It has also become much more customer focused and has launched a series of stylish phones. 7.4.4 Semiconductor Sector Bell Labs invented the transistor in 1947 and its ﬁrst commercial use was products for the hearing impaired. It invented an all-transistor computer in 1954. Motorola set up a research lab in 1952 to take advantage of the potential of semi-conductors, and by 1961 it was mass producing semi-conductors at a low cost. It introduced a transistorized walkie-talkie in 1962 as well as transistors for the Quasar televi- sions. It became the main supplier for the microprocessors used in Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh personal computers. The power PC chip was developed in a partnership with IBM and Apple. Motorola introduced the 8-bit 6,800 microprocessors in 1974 and this micropro- cessor was used in automotive, computing and video games. It contained over 4,000 transistors. It introduced a 16-bit microprocessor in 1979 and this was adopted by Apple for its Macintosh personal computers. It introduced the MC68020, the ﬁrst true 32-bit microprocessor in 1984. This microprocessor contained 200,000 transis- tors on a 3/8 inch square chip. Motorola went through a painful adjustment in the late 1990s and decided to focus on its core business of mobile communications. Its semiconductor business became a separate company called Freescale in 2004. 7.4.5 Motorola and Iridium Iridium was launched in late 1998 to provide global satellite voice and data coverage to its customers. It provides complete coverage of the earth, and this includes the oceans, airways and polar regions. No other form of communication is available in remote areas, and so the concept of Iridium is very valuable. Iridium was implemented by a constellation of 66 satellites. The original design of Iridium required 77 satellites, and the name “Iridium” was chosen as its atomic number in the periodic table is 77. However, the later design required 66 satel- lites, and so Dysprosium which has an atomic number 66 would now be a more appropriate name. The satellites are in low Earth orbit at a height of approximately 485 miles, and communication between satellites is via intersatellite links. The satel- lite contains seven Motorola Power PC 603E processors running at 200 MHz. These machines are used for satellite communication and control. Iridium routes phone calls through space and there are four earth stations. As satellites leave the area of an Earth base station the routing tables change, and frames
