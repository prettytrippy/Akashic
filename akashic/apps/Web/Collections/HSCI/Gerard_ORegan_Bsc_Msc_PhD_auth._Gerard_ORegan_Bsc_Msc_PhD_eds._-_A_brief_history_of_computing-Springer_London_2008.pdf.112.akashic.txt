in the internet community. Initially, the Netscape browser dominated the browser market, and this remained so until Microsoft developed its own browser called Inter- net Explorer. Microsoft’s browser would eventually come to dominate the browser market, after what became known as the browser wars. The eventual dominance of Microsoft internet explorer was controversial, and it was subject to legal investi- gations in the United States. The development of the graphical browsers led to the commercialisation of the world-wide web. The world-wide web creates a space in which users can access information easily in any part of the world. This is done using only a web browser and simple web addresses. The user can then click on hyperlinks on web pages to access further rel- evant information that may be on an entirely different continent. Berners-Lee is now the director of the World Wide Web Consortium, and this MIT based organisation sets the software standards for the Web. 6.6 Applications of the World-Wide Web Berners-Lee used the analogy of the market economy to describe the commercial potential of the world-wide web. He realized that the world-wide web offered the potential to conduct business in cyberspace without human interaction, rather than the traditional way of buyers and sellers coming together to do business in the mar- ket place. Anyone can trade with anyone else except that they do not have to go to the market square to do so The invention of the world-wide web was announced in August 1991, and the growth of the web has been phenomenal since then. The growth has often been exponential, and exponential growth rate curves became a feature of newly formed internet companies, and their business plans. The world-wide web is revolutionary in that: r No single organization is controlling the web. r No single computer is controlling the web. r Millions of computers are interconnected. r It is an enormous market place of millions (billions) of users. r The web is not located in one physical location. r The web is a space and not a physical thing. The world-wide web has been applied to many areas including: r Travel Industry (Booking ﬂights, train tickets, and hotels) r E-Marketing r Ordering books and CDs over the web (such as www.amazon.com) 6.6 Applications of the World-Wide Web 189 r Portal sites (such as Yahoo and Hotmail) r Recruitment Services (such as www.jobserve.com) r Internet Banking r On-line casinos (for gambling) r Newspapers and News Channels r On-line shopping and Shopping Malls The prediction for the growth of e-commerce businesses in the early days of the world-wide web was that the new web-based economy would replace the traditional bricks and mortars companies. The expectation was that most business would be conducted over the web, with traditional enterprises losing market share and even- tually going out of business. Exponential growth of the e-commerce companies was predicted, and the size of the new web economy was estimated to be trillions of U.S. dollars. New companies were formed to exploit the opportunities of the web, and existing companies developed e-business and e-commerce strategies to successfully adapt to the challenge of the brave new world. Companies providing full e-commerce solutions were concerned with the selling of products or services over the web to either businesses or consumers. These business models are referred to as Business- to-Business (B2B) or Business-to-Consumer (B2C). E-commerce web sites have the following characteristics (Table 6.3): Table 6.3 Characteristics of e-commerce Feature Description Catalogue of products The catalogue of products details the products available for sale and their prices. Well designed and easy to use This is essential as otherwise the web site will not be used. Usability requires that it is easy to ﬁnd the relevant information on the web site and that the performance of the site is good. Shopping carts This is analogous to shopping carts in a supermarket. The electronic shopping cart contains the products that the user plans to purchase. The user may add or remove items from the cart. Security Security of credit card information is a key concern for users of the web, as users need to have conﬁdence that their credit card details may not be intercepted. There are technologies such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) that provide encryption of credit card Information. Encryption protects the privacy of the information from un-authorized access. Payments Once the user has completed the selection of purchases there is a check-out facility to arrange for the purchase of the goods. Payment for the products is generally by credit or debit card once the user has completed shopping. Order Fulﬁllment/Order Enquiry Once payment has been received the products must be delivered to the customer. 190 6 The Internet Revolution 6.7 Dot Com Companies The growth of the internet and world-wide web was exponential, and the boom led to the formation of many “new economy” businesses. The key characteristic of these new businesses was that business was largely conducted over the web as dis-
