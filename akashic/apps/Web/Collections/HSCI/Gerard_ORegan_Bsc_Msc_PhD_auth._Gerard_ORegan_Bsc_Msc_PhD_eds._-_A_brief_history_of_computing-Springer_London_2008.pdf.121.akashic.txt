207 even while demand was slack. He also won a major government contract to maintain employment records for over 26 million people. Watson created a division in the early 1930s to lead the engineering, research and development efforts for the entire IBM product line. This was followed by the creation of a modern research and development laboratory, and also a centre dedicated to education and training in New York. The education and development of employees was seen as essential to the success of the business. IBM launched an employee and customer magazine called Think in the 1930s. This magazine included topics such as education and science. IBM contributed to the defense of the United States during the Second World War. It placed all of its plants at the disposal of the US government, and it expanded its product line to include military equipment such as riﬂes. IBM commenced work on computing during the war years. This included work on the Harvard Mark I (also known as ASCC) machine completed in 1944. It was essentially an electromechan- ical calculator that could perform large computations automatically. The machine was 50 feet long and eight feet high and weighed ﬁve tons. It per- formed additions in less than a second, multiplications in 6 seconds, and division in about 12 seconds. It used electromechanical relays to perform the calculations. 7.2.2 Early IBM Computers The company developed the Vacuum Tube Multiplier in 1943 and this was impor- tant in the move from electromechanical to electronic machines. It was the ﬁrst complete machine ever to perform arithmetic electronically by substituting vacuum tubes for electric relays. The key advantages of the vacuum tubes is that they were faster, smaller, and easier to replace than the electromechanical switches used in the Mark I. They allowed engineers to process information thousands of times faster. The company introduced its ﬁrst large computer based on the vacuum tube in 1952. This machine was called the IBM 701, and it executed 17,000 instructions per second (Fig. 7.4). It was used mainly for government work and also for business applications. Transistors began to replace vacuum tubes in the late 1950s. Thomas Watson, Sr., retired in 1952 and his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., became chief executive ofﬁcer the same year. Thomas Watson, Jr. believed that the future of IBM was in computers rather than in tabulators (Fig. 7.5). He recognized the future role that computers would play in business, and realised that IBM needed to change to adopt to the new technology world. He played a key role in the transformation of IBM from its existing business model to a company that would become the world leader in the computer industry. IBM introduced the IBM 650 (Magnetic Drum Calculator) in 1954. This was an intermediate sized electronic computer designed to handle widely diversiﬁed accounting and scientiﬁc computations. It was used by universities and businesses. The machine included a central processing unit, a power unit and a card reader. 208 7 Famous Technology Companies Fig. 7.4 IBM 701 Courtesy of IBM archives. The IBM 704 data processing system was a large computer that was introduced in 1954. It included core memory and ﬂoating-point arithmetic, and was used for both scientiﬁc and commercial applications. It included high speed memory which was faster and much more reliable than the cathode-ray-tube memory storage mech- anism employed in earlier machines. It also had a magnetic drum storage unit which could store parts of the program and intermediate results. The interaction with the system was either by magnetic tape or punched cards entered through the card reader. The program instructions or data were initially produced on punched cards. They were then either converted to magnetic tape or read directly into the system, and data processing performed. The output from the processing was then sent to a line printer, magnetic tape or punched cards. Multipli- cation and division was performed in 240 microseconds. The designers of the IBM 704 included John Backus and Gene Amdahl. Backus was one of the key designers of the Fortran programming language introduced by IBM in 1957. Fortran was the ﬁrst scientiﬁc programming language and has been used extensively by engineers and scientists. Gene Amdahl later went on to found his own company in 1970 (i.e., the Amdahl Corporation1). The ﬁrst commercial computer with transistor logic (the IBM 7090) was intro- duced in 1958. It was designed for large-scale scientiﬁc applications, and it was over 13 times faster than the older vacuum tube IBM 701. It could perform 229,000 1 Amdahl went on to rival IBM and became a threat to the success of IBM. At its peak, Amdahl
