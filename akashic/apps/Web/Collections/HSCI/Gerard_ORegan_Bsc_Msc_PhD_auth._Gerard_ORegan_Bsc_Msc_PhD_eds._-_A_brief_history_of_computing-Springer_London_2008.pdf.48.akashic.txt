He died at the relatively young age of 54 in 1957, and his death was the result of cancer possibly obtained due to exposure to radiation from atomic bomb tests in the paciﬁc. There is an annual IEEE von Neumann medal awarded by IEEE for outstanding achievements in computer science. 2.7.1 Von Neumann Architecture The earliest computing machines had ﬁxed programs that were designed to do a speciﬁc task. For example, Babbage’s difference engine and the tabulating machines 66 2 Foundations developed by Hermann Hollerith were ﬁxed program computers. The limitation of a ﬁxed program computer is that it is designed and programmed to do a speciﬁc task (or tasks). If it is required to change the program of such a machine then it is usually necessary to re-wire and re-design the machine. That is, the early machines were designed for the particular problem that needed to be solved. In contrast, today’s computers are more general purpose, and are designed to allow a variety of pro- grams to be run on the machine. The process of re-designing the early comput- ers was a complex manual process, and involved engineering designs and physical changes. Von Neumann architecture is a computer design that uses a single store for both machine instructions and programs. It is also known as a stored program computer and it is a sequential architecture. Virtually every computer is a von Neumann machine and von Neumann is cred- ited with inventing this architecture. However, Eckhert and Mauchly also con- tributed to the architecture as they were working on this concept during their work on ENIAC, and in designing its successor EDVAC. The ENIAC was a machine that had to be physically rewired in order to perform different tasks, and it was clear to the team that there was a need for an architecture that would allow a machine to perform different tasks without physical rewiring each time. Von Neumann architecture arose on work done by von Neumann, Eckhert, Mauchy and others on the design of EDVAC which was the successor to ENIAC. Von Neumann was working as a consultant to the United States. Army Ordnance Department at the time, and his draft report on EDVAC [VN:45] described the new architecture. EDVAC itself was built in 1949. The key components of von Neumann architecture include (Table 2.12): Table 2.12 Von Neumann architecture Component Description Arithmetic Unit The arithmetic unit is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. Control Unit Executes the instructions that are stored in memory. The program counter contains the address of the next instruction to be executed, and this instruction is fetched from memory and executed. That is, the basic cycle is Fetch and Execute (as in Fig. 2.24) and the control unit contains a built in set of machine instructions. Input–Output Unit The Input and output unit allows the computer to interact with the outside world. The input of what needs to be computed is entered, and the computed results are printed or displayed. Memory There is a one dimensional memory that stores all of the program instructions and data. These are usually kept in different areas of memory. The memory may be written to or read from: i.e., it is random access memory (RAM). The program itself and the data reside in the same memory. The program instructions are binary values, and the control unit decodes the binary value to determine the particular instruction to execute. 2.7 Von Neumann 67 Fig. 2.24 Fetch-execute cycle Memory CPU Accumulator Fetch Execute Decode (Instructions / Data) The key approach to building a general purpose device according to von Neu- mann was in its ability to store not only its data and the intermediate results of computation, but also to store the instructions, or commands for the computation. The computer instructions can be part of the hardware for specialized machines, but for general purpose machines the computer instructions must be as changeable as the data that is acted upon by the instructions. Von Neumann’s insight was to recognize that both the machine instructions and data could be stored in the same memory. The key advantage of the new von Neumann architecture was that it was much simpler to reconﬁgure a computer to compute a different task. All that was required was to put the new machine instructions in computer memory rather than physically rewiring a machine that was required with ENIAC (Fig. 2.25). The generally accepted ﬁrst computer with a von Neumann architecture was the Manchester Mark I computer.20 It was designed and built at Manchester University in England by Frederic Williams, Tom Kilburn and others. Their ﬁrst prototype Mark 1 computer was called “Baby” (Fig. 2.26), and it ran its ﬁrst stored program in 1948. Fig. 2.25 Two women working with ENIAC computer
