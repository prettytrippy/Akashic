nology. The company entered the mobile phone market in the early 1980s, and at that time there was a very expensive public mobile phone network14 in place in Germany. Siemens supplied new mobile radio system equipment to Deutch Bundespost in the mid-1980s, and this technology allowed subscribers to be reached at their own num- bers. It introduced its ﬁrst mobile phone (C1) in the mid-1980s. It weighed 8.8 Kg or 19 pounds. Today, many mobile phones weigh less than 200 grams. Siemens made its ﬁrst GSM call in the early 1990s. Siemens has a number of joint ventures with companies such as Fujitsu, Nokia and Bosch. The joint venture with Fujitsu is now Europe’s leading IT manufac- turer. Fujitsu Siemens’ portfolio ranges from high-performance servers, to PCs, notebooks, and so on. Nokia–Siemens Networks has world class research and development, and its mission is to advance the development of product platforms and services for the next-generation of ﬁxed and mobile networks. Siemens is an innovative company and its products and services are familiar to consumers world-wide. 7.8 HP Hewlett Packard was founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in 1939. They were both classmates at Stanford University, and graduated in engineering in 1934. Packard then took a position with General Electric, and Hewlett continued with graduate studies in Stanford/MIT. They built their ﬁrst product in a Palo Alto garage, and this was an electronic test instrument used by sound engineers. Walt Disney Studios was an early HP customer. The company began to grow during the early 1940s with orders from the US government. Hewlett and Packard created a management style for the company, and over time this became known as the HP way. The HP way was highly effective, and HP’s corporate culture was later copied by several technology companies. The HP way included a strong commitment by the company to its employees, and a strong belief in the basic goodness of people and in their desire to do a good job. It believed that if employees are given the proper tools to do their job that they would then do a good job. There was a ﬁrm conviction that each person had the right to be treated with respect and dignity. The HP management technique was known as “management by walking around”, and this is characterised by the personal involvement of management. This includes good listening skills by the manager, and the recognition that everyone in a company wants to do a good job. The HP way involves management by objectives: i.e., senior 14 This network supported 11,000 users in Germany and was staffed by 600 staff who were respon- sible for switching the calls of the subscribers. The use of this network was the preserve of the super rich in Germany as the cost of phones and calls were prohibitive for the general public. 7.9 Miscellaneous 231 managers communicate the overall objectives clearly to their employees. Employees are then given the ﬂexibility to work towards those goals in ways that are best for their own area of responsibility. The HP Way was reﬁned further in the late 1950s, and the company objectives included seven areas. These are proﬁt, customers, ﬁelds of interest, growth, people, management and citizenship. HP also established an open door policy to create an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding. The open door policy encouraged employees to discuss problems with a manager without fear of reprisals or adverse consequences. HP addressed employees by their ﬁrst name and provided good beneﬁts to its employ- ees. This included free medical insurance and the provision of regular parties for employees. HP was the ﬁrst company to introduce ﬂexitime, and this was intro- duced in the late 1960s. The concept was based on trust and it allowed employ- ees to arrive early or late for work as long as they worked a standard number of hours. HP entered the microwave ﬁeld during the Second World War and it later became a leader in the technology. It became a public quoted company in 1957, and set up two plants in Europe in the late-1950s. It moved into the medical device sector in the 1960s and developed its ﬁrst com- puter in the mid-1960s. HP’s research laboratory was established in 1966, and it became a leading commercial research centre. The company introduced the hand held scientiﬁc calculator in the early 1970s, and this invention made the slide rule obsolete. HP become a major player in the computer industry in the 1980s, and its product portfolio included desktop com- puters and mini-computers. It also introduced a set of inkjet and laser printers. It introduced a touchscreen personal computer in the early 1980s.
