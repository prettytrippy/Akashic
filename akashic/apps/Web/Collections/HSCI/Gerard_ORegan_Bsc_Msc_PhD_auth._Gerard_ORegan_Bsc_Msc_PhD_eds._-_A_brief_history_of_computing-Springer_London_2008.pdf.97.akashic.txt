room may lack intelligence, but the system as a whole is intelligence. However, this rebuttal argument has been criticized by others as begging the question. 8 I don’t believe that Searle’s argument proves that Strong AI is impossible. However, I am not expecting to see intelligent machines anytime soon. 160 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems 5.4 Philosophy and AI Artiﬁcial Intelligence includes the study of knowledge and the mind, and there are deep philosophical problems to be solved in the ﬁeld. The philosophy of epistemol- ogy and the philosophy of mind are concerned with fundamental questions such as: r What is being? r What is knowledge? r What is mind? r What is consciousness? Early work on philosophy was done by the Greeks as they attempted to understand the world and the nature of being and reality.9 Thales and the Miletians10 attempted to ﬁnd an underlying principle: e.g., water, or for other Miletians, earth, air, wind and ﬁre, where such a principle that would explain everything. Pythagoras believed that mathematical numbers were the basic underlying principle, and that everything (e.g., music) could be explained in terms of number. Plato distinguished between the world of appearances and the world of reality. He argued that the world of appearances resembles the ﬂickering shadows on a cave wall, whereas reality is in the world of ideas11 or forms, in which objects of this world somehow participate. Aristotle wondered how many forms there are: for example, is there a separate form for a dog, breed of dog, etc. Aristotle proposed the framework of a substance which includes form plus matter. For example, the matter of a wooden chair is the wood that it is composed of, and its form is the general form of a chair. The problem of being is relevant to the mind-body problem in AI. Acquinus was a medieval scholastic philosopher who was deeply inﬂuenced by Aristotle.12 Acquinus distinguished between matter and form and also considered questions such as existence and understanding. Modern Thomists,13 such as Bernart Lonergan have developed his ideas into the nature of understanding and cognition. Lonergans’s study of cognition [Lon:58] was inﬂuenced by the eureka step in the discovery of Archimedes, and also the in the sudden insight in which the solution of a mathematical puzzle comes about. Lonergan outlines the steps associated with the sudden insight that comes in solving a mathematical puzzle or scientiﬁc discovery. Artiﬁcial Intelligence requires a theory of cognition if it is to make serious progress. 9 The study of philosophical questions related to being is referred to as Ontology (or Metaphysics). The study of philosophical questions related to knowledge is referred to as epistemology. 10 The term “Miletians” refers to inhabitants of the Greek city state Miletus which is located in modern Turkey. Anaximander and Anaximenes were two other Miletians who made contributions to early Greek philosophy approx 600 BC. 11 Plato was an Idealist: i.e., that reality is in the world of ideas rather than the external world. Realists (in contrast) believe that the external world corresponds to our mental ideas. 12 He refers to Aristotle as “The Philosopher” in Sumna Theologicae. 13 The term “Thomist” denotes a follower of the philosophy of St. Thomas Acquinus. 5.4 Philosophy and AI 161 Descartes was discussed earlier and his inﬂuence on the philosophy of mind and AI is signiﬁcant. He was deeply concerned with a ﬁrm foundation for knowledge and being, and his approach was to doubt everything that could be doubted except his own existence. He deduced his own existence from the fact that he could think: i.e., Cogito, ergo sum.14 This thinking thing (res cogitans or mind/soul) was dis- tinct from the rest of nature and interacted with the world through the senses to gain knowledge. Knowledge was gained by mental operations using the deductive method, where starting from the premises that are known to be true, further truths could be logically deduced. Descartes founded what would become known as the Rationalist school of philosophy where knowledge was derived solely by human reasoning. He distinguished between the mind and the body (Cartesian dualism), and the analogy of the mind in AI would be the central processor unit (or an AI pro- gram) of a computer, with knowledge gained by sense perception by the computer hardware (e.g., machine vision) and logical deduction. British Empiricism rejected the Rationalist position, and stressed the importance of empirical data in gaining knowledge about the world. Its philosophy argued that all knowledge is derived from sense experience. It consisted of philosophers such as
