overseas who spent several months there. It also had a large pool of permanent staff. 186 6 The Internet Revolution Fig. 6.2 Tim Berners-Lee Photo courtesy of Wikipedia. Visiting scientists used to come and go, and in the late 1980s there was no efﬁcient and effective way to share information among scientists. It was often desirable for a visiting scientist to obtain information or data from the CERN computers. In other cases, the scientist wished to make results of their research available to CERN in an easy manner. Berners-Lee developed a program called “Enquire” to assist with information sharing, and the program also assisted in keeping track of the work of visiting scientists. He returned to CERN in the mid- 1980s to work on other projects, and he devoted part of his free time to consider solutions to the information sharing problem. This was eventually to lead to his breakthrough and his invention of the world-wide web in 1990. Inventors tend to be inﬂuenced by existing inventions, and especially inventions that are relevant to their areas of expertise. The internet was a key existing inven- tion, and it allowed world wide communication via electronic email, the transfer of ﬁles electronically via FTP, and newsgroups that allowed users to make postings on various topics. Another key invention that was relevant to Berners-Lee was that of hypertext. This was invented by Ted Nelson in the 1960s, and it allow links to be present in text. For example, a document such as a book contains a table of contents, an index, and a bibliography. These are all links to material that is either within the book itself or external to the book. The reader of a book is able to follow the link to obtain the internal or external information. The other key invention that was relevant to Berners-Lee was that of the mouse. This was invented by Doug Engelbart in the 1960s, and it allowed the cursor to be steered around the screen. The major leap that Berners-Lee made was essen- tially a marriage of the internet, hypertext and the mouse into what has become the 6.5 Birth of the World-Wide Web 187 world-wide web. His vision and its subsequent realisation was beneﬁcial both to CERN and the wider world. He described the vision as follows [BL:00]: Suppose that all information stored on computers everywhere were linked. Program com- puter to create a space where everything could be linked to everything. Berners-Lee essentially created a system to give every “page” on a computer a stan- dard address. This standard address is called the universal resource locator and is better known by its acronym URL. Each page is accessible via the hypertext trans- fer protocol (HTTP), and the page is formatted with the hypertext markup language (HTML). Each page is visible using a web-browser. The key features of Berners-Lee invention are (Table 6.2): Table 6.2 Features of world-wide web Feature Description URL Universal Resource Identiﬁer (later renamed to Universal Resource Locator (URL). This provides a unique address code for each web page. Browsers decode the URL location to access the web page. For example, www.amazon.com uniquely identiﬁes the Amazon.com host web site in the United States. HTML Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is used for designing the layout of web pages. It allows the formatting of pages containing hypertext links. HTML is standardized and controlled by the World Wide Web Consortium (http://www.w3.org). HTTP The Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) allows a new web page to be accessed from the current page. Browser A browser is a client program that allows a user to interact with the pages and information on the world-wide web. It uses the HTTP protocol to make requests of web servers throughout the internet on behalf of the browser user. Berners-Lee developed the ﬁrst web browser called the World Wide Web browser. Lee invented the well-known terms such as URL, HTML and world-wide web, and these terms are ubiquitous today. He also wrote the ﬁrst browser program, and this allowed users to access web pages throughout the world. Browsers are used to connect to remote computers over the internet, and to request, retrieve and dis- play the web pages on the local machine. The invention of the world-wide web by Berners-Lee was a revolution in the use of the internet. Users could now surf the web: i.e., hyperlink among the millions of computers in the world and obtain information easily. 188 6 The Internet Revolution The early browsers included Gopher developed at the University of Minnesota, and Mosaic developed at the University of Illinois. These were replaced in later years by Netscape and the objective of its design was to create a graphical-user- interface browser that would be easy to use, and would gain widespread acceptance
