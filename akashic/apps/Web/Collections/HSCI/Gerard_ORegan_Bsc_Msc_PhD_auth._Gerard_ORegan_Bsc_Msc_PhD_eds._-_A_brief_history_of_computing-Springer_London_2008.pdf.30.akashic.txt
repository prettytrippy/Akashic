contributions to probability theory, differential equations, and ﬁnite differences. He is especially remembered for his major contribution to Boolean algebra which is the foundation for modern computing. Boole is therefore considered (along with Babbage) to be one of the fathers of computing. Boole, never actually built any computer, as he lived well before the computer age. However, the mathematical foundation provided by Boole was exactly what was required for telephone switch- ing and computing, and it was Claude Shannon who saw the potential of Boole’s work, and who brought it to practical fruition. Boole’s work remains important today. Fig. 2.1 George Boole 30 2 Foundations Boole was interested in formulating a calculus of reasoning, and in 1847 he pub- lished a pamphlet titled “Mathematical Analysis of Logic” [Boo:48]. This article developed novel ideas on a logical method, and he argued that logic should be con- sidered as a separate branch of mathematics, rather than being considered a part of philosophy. Boole argued that there are mathematical laws to express the operation of reasoning in the human mind, and he showed how Aristotle’s syllogistic logic could be rendered as algebraic equations. This publication was well received, and the British mathematician and logician De-Morgan1 spoke highly of it. There was regular correspondence between Boole and De-Morgan on logic. Boole was inter- ested in obtaining a university position, but due to his lack of a formal university education it was therefore difﬁcult for him to achieve this goal. However, the value of his publications were recognized in Britain, and in view of the excellence of his work,2 and especially the pamphlet on Logic, he was awarded the position as the ﬁrst professor of mathematics at the newly founded Queens University of Cork,3 Ireland in 1849. Boole’s inﬂuential paper on a calculus of logic introduced two quantities 0 and 1. He used the quantity 1 to represent the universe of thinkable objects (i.e., the universal set), with the quantity 0 representing the absence of any objects (i.e., the empty set). He then employed symbols such as x, y, z, etc., to represent collections or classes of objects given by the meaning attached to adjectives and nouns. Next, he introduced three operators (+, −, and ×) that combined classes of objects. For example, the expression xy (i.e., x multiplied by y) combines the two classes x, y to form the new class xy (i.e., the class whose objects satisfy the two meanings represented by the classes x and y). Similarly, the expression x+y combines the two classes x, y to form the new class x +y (that satisﬁes either the meaning represented by class x or class y). The expression x −y combines the two classes x, y to form the new class x −y. This represents the class (that satisﬁes the meaning represented by class x but not class y). The expression (1 −x) represents objects that do not have the attribute that represents class x. Thus, if x = black and y = sheep, then xy represents the class of black sheep. Similarly, (1 −x) would represents the class obtained by the operation of selecting all things in the world except black things; x(1−y) represents the class of all things that areblack but not sheep; and (1 −x) · (1 −y) would give us all things that are 1 De-Morgan was a 19th British mathematician based at University College London, and is well- known for De-Morgan’s laws in Set Theory and Logic: ¬ (A ∪B) = ¬A ∩¬B and ¬ (A ∨B) = ¬A ∧¬B. In Boole’s notation this would be expressed as (1 −(A + B)) = (1 −A) · (1 −B). This is written as (A + B) = ¯A ¯B in Shannon’s notation. 2 Boole was awarded the Royal Medal from the Royal Society of London in 1844 in recognition of his publications. The Irish Mathematician, Sir. Rowan Hamilton, (who discovered Quaternions) was another famous recipient of this prize. Hamilton was awarded the medal in 1835. Boole was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1857. 3 Queens University Cork is now called University College Cork (UCC) and has about 15,000 students. It is located in Cork city in the south of Ireland. Queens University Belfast and Queens University Galway (now NUI, Galway) were founded the same year. 2.2 Boole 31 neither sheep nor black. Similarly, if z = goats then y + z represents the class that
