For example, the company may plan to be more competitive on cost than other players, or it may be targeting a niche market. 6.7.3 Bubble and Burst Netscape was founded as Mosaic Communications by Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark in 1994. It was renamed as Netscape in late 1994. The initial public offering of the company in 1995 demonstrated the incredible value of the new internet com- panies. The company had planned to issue the share price at $14 but decided at the last minute to issue it at $28. The share price reached $75 later that day. This was 6.7 Dot Com Companies 195 followed by what became, in effect, the dot com bubble where there were a large number of public offerings of internet stock, and where the value of these stocks reached astronomical levels. Eventually, reality returned to the stock market when it crashed in April 2000, and share values returned to more sustainable levels. The valuations of these companies were extraordinary. The vast majority of these companies were losing substantial sums of money, and few expected to deliver prof- its in the short term. Traditional forms of determining the value of a company using accounts such as the balance sheet, proﬁt and loss account, and price to earnings ratio were ignored. Instead, investment bankers argued that there was now a new paradigm in stock valuation. This brave new world argued that the potential future earnings of the stock should be considered in determining the appropriate valua- tion of the stock. This was used to justify the high prices of shares in technology companies, and frenzied investors rushed to buy these over-priced and over-hyped stocks. Common sense seemed to play no role in decision making, and this is a characteristic of a bubble. The dot com bubble included features such as: r Irrational exuberance on the part of investors r Insatiable appetite for Internet Stocks r Incredible greed from all parties involved r A lack of rationality by all concerned r No relationship between Balance Sheet/Proﬁt and Loss and the share price r Interest in Making Money rather than in building the business ﬁrst r Following Herd Mentality r Questionable Decisions by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan r Questionable Analysis by Investment Firms r Conﬂict of Interest in Investment Banks between Analysis for Investors and earn- ing revenue from IPOs r Market had left reality behind However, many individuals and companies made a lot of money from the boom, although many other investors including pension funds and life assurance funds made signiﬁcant losses. The investment banks typically earned 5%–7% commission on each successful IPO, and it was therefore in their interest not to question the boom too closely. Those investors that bought early and disposed early obtained a good return; however, many of those who held shares for too long incurred losses. The full extent of the boom can be seen from Figs. 6.3 and 6.4 which show the increase in value of the Dow Jones and Nasdaq from 1995 through 2002. The extraordinary rise of the Dow Jones from a level of 3800 in 1995 to 11900 in 2000 represented a 200% increase over 5 years or approximately 26% annual growth (compound)over 5 years. The rise of the Nasdaq over this time period is even more dramatic. It rose from a level of 751 in 1995 to 5000 in 2000 representing a 566% increase over the time period. This is equivalent to a 46% compounded annual growth rate of the index. The fall of the indices have been equally dramatic especially in the case of the Nasdaq which peaked at 5000 in March 2000 had fallen by 76%–1200% by Septem- ber 2002. It had become clear that internet companies were rapidly going through 196 6 The Internet Revolution Dow Jones Trend 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Dow Jones Trend Fig. 6.3 Dow Jones (1995–2002) Nasdaq Trend 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 1995 1996 1997 1999 1998 2000 2001 2002 Nasdaq Trend Fig. 6.4 Nasdaq (1995–2002) the cash raised at the IPOs, and analysts noted that a signiﬁcant number would be out of cash by end of 2000. Therefore, these companies would either go out of business, or would need to go back to the market for further funding. This led to questioning of the hitherto relatively unquestioned business models of many of
