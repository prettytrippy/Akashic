tive solutions to problems. That is, the proof of the existence was generally accom- panied by an actual construction of the solution using an unmarked straightedge 12 1 Early Civilisations and compass. The material in the Euclid’s Elements is presented logically, and it is a systematic development of geomerty starting from the small set of axioms, pos- tulates and deﬁnitions, and it leads to theorems derived logically from the axioms and postulates. Euclid’s deductive method has inﬂuenced later mathematicians and scientists. There are some jumps in reasoning in The Elements, and Hilbert added extra axioms to Euclidean geometry to make it more complete in the late nineteenth century. The Elements contains many well-known mathematical results such as: r Pythagoras’s Theorem r Thales Theorem r Sum of Angles in a Triangle r Prime Numbers r Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple r Euclidean Algorithm r Areas and Volumes r Tangents to a point r Algebra The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest known algorithms and is employed to produce the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It is presented in the Elements but was known well before Euclid. The formulation of the gcd algorithm for two natural numbers a and b is as follows: 1. Check if b is zero. If so, then a is the gcd. 2. Otherwise, the gcd (a, b) is given by gcd (b, a mod b). It is also possible to determine integers p and q such that ap + bq = gcd(a, b). The proof of the Euclidean algorithm is as follows. Suppose a and b are two positive numbers whose gcd has to be determined, and let r be the remainder when a is divided by b. 1. Clearly a = qb + r where q is the quotient of the division. 2. Any common divisor of a and b is also a divider or r (since r = a −qb). 3. Similarly, any common divisor of b and r will also divide a. 4. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of a and b is the same as the greatest common divisor of b and r. 5. The number r is smaller than b and we will reach r = 0 in ﬁnitely many steps. 6. The process continues until r = 0. Comment 1.1 Algorithms are fundamental in computing as they deﬁne the proce- dure by which a problem is solved. A computer program implements the algorithm in some programming language. Eratosthenes was a Hellenistic mathematician and scientist who worked as librar- ian in the famous library in Alexandria. He devised a system of latitude and longi- tude, and became the ﬁrst person to estimate of the size of the circumference of the earth. His approach to the calculation was as follows (Fig. 1.6): 1.4 The Greeks 13 Fig. 1.6 Eratosthenes measurement of the circumference of the earth 1. On the summer solstice at noon in the town of Aswan14 on the Tropic of Cancer in Egypt the sun appears directly overhead. 2. Eratosthenes believed that the earth was a sphere. 3. He assumed that rays of light came from the sun in parallel beams and reached the earth at the same time. 4. At the same time in Alexandria he had measured that the sun would be 7.2◦south of the zenith. 5. He assumed that Alexandria was directly north of Aswan. 6. He concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Aswan was 7.2/360 of the circumference of the earth. 7. Distance between Alexandria and Aswan was 5000 stadia (approximately 800 km). 8. He established a value of 252,000 stadia or approximately 39,6000km. Eratosthene’s calculation was within 1% of the true value of 40,008 km and was an impressive result for 200 BC. The errors in his calculation were due to: 1. Aswan is not exactly on the Tropic of Cancer but it is actually 55 km north of it. 2. Alexandria is not exactly north of Aswan and there is a difference of 3◦longitude. 3. The distance between Aswan and Alexandtia is 729 km not 800 km. 4. Angles in antiquity could not be measured with absolute precision. 5. The angular distance is actually 7.08◦and not 7.2◦. Eratosthenes also calculated the approximate distance to the moon and sun and he also produced maps of the known world. He developed a very useful algorithm for determining all of the prime numbers up to a speciﬁed integer. The method is known
