1 Weizenbaum was a psychologist who invented the ELIZA program. This program simulated a psychologist in dialogue with a patient. He was initially an advocate of Artiﬁcial Intelligence but later became a critic. 149 150 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems Perhaps, one of the earliest references to creating life by artiﬁcial means is that of the classical myth of Pygmalion. Pygmalion was a sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory. The sculpture was so realistic that he fell in love with it, and offered the statue presents and prayed to Aphrodite the goddess of love. Aphrodite took pity on him and brought the statue (Galathea) to life. Pygmalion and Galathea married and had a son Paphos. Aristotle developed syllogistic logic in the fourth century B.C. This was the ﬁrst formal deductive reasoning system, and was discussed in Chapter 1. A syllogism consists of two premises (or propositions) and one conclusion. Each premise con- sists of two terms and there is one common middle term. The conclusion consists of the two unrelated terms from the premises. This is best illustrated by an example: Premise 1 All Greeks are Mortal Premise 2 Socrates is a Greek. ............................... Conclusion Socrates is Mortal Aristotle studied the various syllogisms and determined which were valid or invalid. Aristotle’s syllogistic logic was used widely until the nineteenth century. It allowed further truths to be derived from existing truths. Ramon Llull was a medieval writer and philosopher in the thirteenth century. He was born in Palma, Mallorca in the Balearic Islands. He did some pioneering work in computation theory by designing a method of combining attributes selected from a number of lists. He intended his method to be used as a debating tool to convert Muslims to the Christian faith through logic and reason. Llull’s machine allowed a reader to enter an argument or question about the Christian faith, and the reader would then turn to the appropriate index and page to ﬁnd the correct answer. Llull’s method was an early attempt to use logical means to produce knowledge. He hoped to show that Christian doctrines could be obtained artiﬁcially from a ﬁxed set of preliminary ideas or undeniable truths. For example, the attributes of God as a supremely good, benevolent, omnipotent being were undeniable truths, and agreed between the main mono-theistic faiths of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. He believed that each ﬁeld of knowledge had a limited number of basic undeniable truths, and that everything could be understood about the ﬁelds of knowledge by studying combinations of these elementary truths. Llull’s machine is called the Lullian Circle and it consists of two or more paper discs inscribed with alphabetic letters or symbols. These discs may be rotated sepa- rately to generate a large combination of ideas. A number of terms were laid around the full circumference of the circle, and repeated on an inner circle that could be rotated. These combinations were said to show all possible truths about the subject of the circle. Llull was opposed by the Grand Inquisitor of Aragon, and some of his writings were banned by the pope. The creation of man by God is described in Genesis in the Bible. There are sev- eral stories of attempts by man to create life from inanimate objects: for example, the creation of the monster in Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. These stories go back to an earlier period: for example, there are stories of the creation of the golem in 5.2 Descartes 151 Prague dating back to sixteenth century. The word “golem” is used in the Bible to refer to an incomplete substance, and the word is generally used today to describe someone who is clumsy or slow. All golems were created from mud by a very holy person who was very close to God, and who was able to create life. However, the life that the holy person could create would always be a shadow of one created by God. Golems became servants to the holy men but were unable to speak. The possession of a golem servant was a sign of the wisdom and holiness of the beholder. Other attributes of the golem were added over time, and included inscription with magical words to keep the golem animated. This also allowed the golem to be deactivated by inscribing the word “death” on the forehead of the golem. The most famous golem story involved Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague. He was a sixteenth century rabbi and is said to have created a golem to defend the Jews of Prague from attack. According to the story the golem was created from clay on the banks of the Vltava river in Prague, and was brought to life by the Rabbi
