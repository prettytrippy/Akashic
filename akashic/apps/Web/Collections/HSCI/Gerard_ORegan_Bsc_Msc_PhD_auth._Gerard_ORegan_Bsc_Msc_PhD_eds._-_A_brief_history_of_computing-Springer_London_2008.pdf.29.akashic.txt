ﬁgures such as Boole, Babbage, Turing, Shannon and Von Neumann. George Boole was a nineteenth century English mathematician who is considered one of the fathers of computing. His calculus of logic is known as Boolean Algebra and is the foundation of all modern computers. Charles Babbage was a nineteenth century scientist who did pioneering work on the Difference Engine (a sophisticated calculator that could be used for the produc- tion of mathematical tables). Babbage also designed the Analytic Engine, and this was the design of the world’s ﬁrst mechanical computer. It included a processor, memory, and a way to input information and output results. However, the machine was never built during Babbage’s lifetime. Babbage intended that the program be stored on read-only memory using punch cards and that input and output for the Analytic Engine be carried out using punch cards. He intended that the machine would be able to store numbers and intermediate 27 28 2 Foundations results in memory where they could then be processed. He even intended that the machine would be capable of parallel processing, where several calculations could be performed at once. Turing was a famous twentieth century English mathematician and computer scientist. His mathematical Turing Machine proved that anything that is computable is computable by this theoretical machine. He also made contributions to the British war effort during the second-world war while working at Bletchey Park. This team at Bletchey succeeded in breaking the German Enigma codes. Turing also did impor- tant work in Artiﬁcial Intelligence and he devised the famous “Turing Test” as a test of machine intelligence. He also did work at Manchester University prior to his premature death in the early 1950s. Claude Shannon was an American mathematician and engineer who made fun- damental contributions to computing. He was the ﬁrst person to see the applicability of Boolean algebra to simplify the design of circuits and telephone routing switches. His inﬂuential Masters Thesis is a key milestone in computing, and it shows how to lay out circuits according to Boolean principles. It provides the theoretical foun- dation of switching circuits, and his insight of using the properties of electrical switches to do Boolean logic is the basic concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon’s later work at Bell Labs laid the foundation of modern information theory. Information theory is concerned with the problem of reliable transfer of messages from a source point to a destination point. This includes the transfer of messages over any communications medium: for example, television, radio, tele- phone, and computers. The fundamental problem of communication is to reproduce at a destination point either exactly or approximately a message that has been sent from a source point. The problem is that information may be distorted by noise and the received message may differ from the original sent. Shannon provided a math- ematical deﬁnition and framework for information theory that remains the standard today. He also made a signiﬁcant contribution to the emerging ﬁeld of cryptography. John von Neumann was a Hungarian mathematician who made fundamental con- tributions to mathematics, set theory, computer science, and the American atomic bomb programme. His PhD thesis showed how the paradoxes in set theory could be avoided by employing the concept of a class. He gave his name to the well-known von Neumann architecture used in almost all computers. The key features of von Neumann architecture are an arithmetic unit for performing basic arithmetic operations; a control unit; an input-output unit and memory. The control unit executes the instructions stored in memory, and uses a program counter to fetch the next instruction in memory, which it then executes. The input-output unit allows the computer to interact with the outside world, and the one-dimensional memory tcontains the program instructions and data. Von Neumann also created the ﬁeld of cellular automata, and invented the merge- sort algorithm (in which the ﬁrst and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged). There is an annual IEEE von Neumann medal that is awarded by the IEEE to researchers for outstanding achievements in computer science. 2.2 Boole 29 2.2 Boole Boole (1815–1864) was born of humble parents in Lincoln, England. His father was a cobbler with an active mind who was interested in mathematics and optical instru- ments. He provided an early inﬂuence on his son by teaching him mathematics, and teaching him how to make optical instruments. George Boole (Fig. 2.1) inherited his father’s interest in knowledge, and was self-taught in mathematics. He was taught Latin by a tutor, but was self-taught in Greek. He taught in various schools near Lincoln, and developed his mathematical knowledge by working his way through Newton’s Principia, as well as applying himself to the work of mathematicians such as Laplace and Lagrange. He published regular papers from his early twenties onwards, and these included
