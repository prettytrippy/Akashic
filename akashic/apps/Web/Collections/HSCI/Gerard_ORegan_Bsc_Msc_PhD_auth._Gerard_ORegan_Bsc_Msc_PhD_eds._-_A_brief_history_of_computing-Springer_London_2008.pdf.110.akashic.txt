simple mail transfer program (SMTP). It is equivalent to the application and presentation layers on the OSI Model. informed when a packet is lost or delivered out of sequence. A packet is forwarded by the router only if the router knows a route to the destination. Otherwise, it is dropped. Packets are dropped if their checksum is invalid or if their time to live is zero. The acknowledgement of packets is the responsibility of the TCP protocol. The ARPANET employed the TCP/IP protocols as a standard from 1983. The late 1970s saw the development of newsgroups that aimed to provide infor- mation about a particular subject. A newsgroup started with a name that is appropri- ate with respect to the content that it is providing. Newsgroups were implemented via USENET, and were an early example of client-server architecture. A user dials in to a server with a request to forward a certain newsgroup postings; the server then “serves” the request. 6.4 Birth of the Internet The origins of the internet can be traced to the United States government support of the ARPANET project. Computers in several United States universities were linked via packet switching, and this allowed messages to be sent between the universities that were part of the network. The use of ARPANET was limited initially to academia and to the United States military, and in the early years there was little interest from industrial companies. However, by the mid-1980s there were over 2,000 hosts on the TCP/IP enabled network, and the ARPANET was becoming more heavily used and congested. It was decided to shut down the network by the late-1980s, and the National Science 6.5 Birth of the World-Wide Web 185 Foundation in the United States commenced work on the NSFNET. This work com- menced in the mid-1980s, and the network consisted of multiple regional networks connected to a major backbone. The original links in NSFNET were 56 Kbps but these were later updated to the faster T1 (1.544 Mbps) links. The NSFNET T1 back- bone initially connected 13 sites, but this increased due to a growing interest from academic and industrial sites in the United States and from around the world. The NSF began to realize from the mid-1980s onwards that the internet had signiﬁcant commercial potential. The NSFNET backbone was upgraded with T1 links in 1988 and the internet began to become more international. Sites in Canada and several European countries were connected to the internet. DARPA formed the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to deal with any emergency incidents arising during the operation of the network. Advanced Network Services (ANS) was founded in 1991. This was an inde- pendent not-for-proﬁt company, and it installed a new network that replaced the NSFNET T1 network. The ANSNET backbone operated over T3 (45 Mbps) links, and it different from previous networks such as ARPANET and NSFNET in that it was owned and operated by a private company rather than the United States gov- ernment. The NSF decided to focus on research aspects of networks rather than the operational side. The ANSNET network was a move away from a core net- work such as NSFET, to a distributive network architecture operated by commercial providers such as Sprint, MCI and BBN. The network was connected by major network exchange points, termed Network Access Points (NAPs). There were over 160,000 hosts connected to the internet by the late 1980s. The discovery of the world-wide web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1990 was a revolutionary milestone in computing. It has transformed the way that businesses operate as well as transforming the use of the internet from mainly academic (with some commercial use) to an integral part of peoples’ lives. The invention of the world-wide web by Berners-Lee is described in the next section. 6.5 Birth of the World-Wide Web The world-wide web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee (Fig. 6.2) in 1990 at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. CERN is a key European and international center for research in the nuclear ﬁeld, and several thousand physicists and scientists work there. Lee ﬁrst came to CERN in 1980 for a short contract programming assignment. He came from a strong scientiﬁc background as both his parents had been involved in the programming of the Mark I computer at Manchester University in the 1950s. He graduated in physics in the mid-1970s at Oxford University in England. One of the problems that scientists at CERN faced was that of keeping track of people, computers, documents, databases, etc. This problem was more acute due to the international nature of CERN, as the centre had many visiting scientists from
