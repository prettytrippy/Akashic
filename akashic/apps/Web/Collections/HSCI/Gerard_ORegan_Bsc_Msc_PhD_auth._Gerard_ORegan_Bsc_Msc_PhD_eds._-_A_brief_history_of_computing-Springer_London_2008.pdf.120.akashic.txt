initial business was the production of radios for cars and it became a world leader in radio and telecommunications. Motorola produces mobile phones and base stations for the mobile telecommunications ﬁeld. Apple was founded in the mid-1970s. It developed the Apple Macintosh in the mid-1980s. This introduced a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) which made the machine easy to use. The company also produced the iPod. Other companies discussed in this chapter include HP, Oracle and Siemens. 203 204 7 Famous Technology Companies 7.2 International Business Machines IBM is a household name today and the company has a long and distinguished history. In many ways, the history of computing is closely related to the history of IBM, as the company has played a key role in the development of the computers that we are familiar with today. The origins of the company go back to the late nineteenth century with the processing of the 1880 census of the United States. The processing of the 1880 census took 7 years to complete as all the processing was done manually. The population of the United States was steadily increasing at this time, and it was predicted that the 1890 census would take in excess of 10 years to process. The US Census Bureau recognised that the current methodology for processing census results was no longer ﬁt for purpose. Therefore, it decided to hold a contest among its employees in an effort to ﬁnd a more efﬁcient methodology to tabulate the census data. The winner was Hermann Hollerith who was the son of a German immigrant (Fig. 7.1).

His punch card Tabulating Machine used an electric current to sense holes in punched cards, and it kept a running total of the data (Fig. 7.2). His machine used Babbage’s idea of punched cards for data storage. The new methodology enabled the results of the 1890 census to be available within 6 weeks, and the population was recorded to be over 62 million. 7.2.1 Early Years Hollerith formed the Tabulating Machine Company in Washington, D.C., in 1896. This was the world’s ﬁrst electric tabulating-machine company, and it later merged with the International Time Recording Company to form the Computing Tabulating Recording Company (CTR) in 1911. Thomas Watson Senior became president of the Computing Tabulating Company in 1914 and at that time the company employed 400 people. Watson transformed the company over the following decades to become a global multinational. He was responsible for the famous “Think” signs that have been associated with IBM for many years. They were ﬁrst used in the company in 1915. Watson considered the motivation of the sales force to be an essential part of his job, and the sales people were required to attend an IBM sing along. The verses in the songs were in praise of IBM and its founder Thomas Watson Sr (Fig. 7.3). The company was renamed in 1924 to become International Business Machines (IBM). It employed over 3,000 people in 1924, and had revenues of US $11 million, with 206 7 Famous Technology Companies Fig. 7.3 Thomas Watson Sr Courtesy of IBM archives. a net income of $2 million. It had manufacturing plants in the United States and Europe. By 2005, IBM had revenues of $91.1 billion, net income of $7.9 billion, and it employed over 300,000 people. IBM has evolved to adapt its business to a changing world and emerging trends in the information handling ﬁeld. Its early products were designed to process, store and retrieve information from tabulators and time recording clocks. Today, the company produces powerful computers and global networks, and it is an industry leader in the development of computer systems to meet the needs of business and consumers. IBM redesigned the existing punch card in the late 1920s to create the popu- lar IBM punch card. It had 80 columns which was almost double the capacity of existing cards. The new design was patented, and it included rectangular holes. The company introduced a mechanism by which staff could make improvement suggestions in the 1920s. Many companies today now encourage their staff to make improvement suggestions to deliver better results. The great depression of the 1930s affected many American companies and had a devastating impact on the lives of many Americans. However, surprisingly, its impact on IBM was minimal, and the company continued to grow. The policy of Thomas Watson Sr. and IBM was to take care of its employees, and IBM was one of the ﬁrst corporations to provide life insurance and paid vacations for its employees. Watson kept his workers busy during the depression by producing new machines 7.2 International Business Machines
