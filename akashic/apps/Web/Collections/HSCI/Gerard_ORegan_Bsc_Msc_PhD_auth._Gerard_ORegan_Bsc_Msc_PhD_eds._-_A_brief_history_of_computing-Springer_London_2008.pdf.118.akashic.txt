little, and test a little” as this is generally the best approach to developing a usable application. Various technologies are employed in web developed. These include HTML which is used to design simple web pages and was originally developed by Berners- Lee; CGIs (Common Gateway Interface) are often employed in sending a completed form to a server; cookies are employed to enable the server to store client speciﬁc information on client’s machine. Other popular technologies are Java, Javascript, VB Script, Active X and Flash. There are tools such as Dreamweaver to assist with Web site design. Testing plays an important role in assuring quality and various types of web testing include: r Static testing r Unit testing r Functional testing r Browser compatibility testing r Usability testing r Security testing r Load/performance/stress testing 6.8 E-Software Development 199 r Availability testing r Post deployment testing Static testing generally involves inspections and reviews of documentation. The purpose of static testing of web sites is to check the content of the web pages for accuracy, consistency, correctness, and usability, and also to identify any syntax errors or anomalies in the HTML. The purpose of unit testing is to verify that the content of the web pages correspond to the design, that the content is correct, that all the links are valid, and that the web navigation operates correctly. The purpose of functional testing is to verify that the functional requirements are satisﬁed. Func- tional testing may be quite extensive as e-commerce applications can be quite com- plex. It may involve product catalogue searches, order processing, credit checking and payment processing, as well as interfaces to legacy systems. Also, testing of cookies, whether enabled or disabled, needs to be considered. The purpose of browser compatibility testing is to verify that the web browsers that are to be supported are actually supported. Different browsers implement HTML differently; for example, there are differences between the implementation by Netscape and Microsoft. These days internet explorer is the main web browser as it now dominates the market. The purpose of usability testing is to verify that the look and feel of the applica- tion is good. The purpose of security testing is to ensure that the web site is secure. The purpose of load, performanceand stress testing is to ensure that the performance of the system is within the deﬁned parameters. There are tools to measure web server and operating system parameters and to maintain statistics. These tools allow simulation of a large number of users at one time or simulation of the sustained use of a web site over a long period of time. There is a relationship between the performance of a system and its usability. Usability testing includes testing to verify that the look and feel of the application are good, and that performance of loading of web pages, graphics, etc., is good. There are automated browsing tools which go through all of the links on a page, attempt to load each link, and produce a report including the timing for loading an object or page at various modem speeds. Good usability requires attention to usability in design, and usability engineering is important for web based or GUI applications. The purpose of post-deployment testing is to ensure that the performance of the web site remains good, and this is generally conducted as part of a service level agreement (SLA). Service level agreements typically include a penalty clause if the availability of the system or its performance falls below deﬁned parameters. Con- sequently, it is important to identify as early as possible potential performance and availability issues before they become a problem. Thus post-deployment testing will include monitoring of web site availability, performance, security, etc., and taking corrective action as appropriate. Most web sites are operating 24 × 7 × 365 days a year, and there is the potential for major ﬁnancial loss in the case of an outage of the electronic commerce web site. There is a good account of e-business testing and all the associated issues by Paul Gerrard in detail in [Ger:02]. 200 6 The Internet Revolution 6.9 E-Commerce Security The world-wide web extends over computers in virtually every country in the world. It consists of unknown users with un-predictable behavior operating in unknown countries. These users and web sites may be friendly or hostile and the issue of trust arises. r Is the other person whom they claim to be? r Can the other person be relied upon to deliver the goods on-payment? r Can the other person be trusted not to inﬂict malicious damage? r Is ﬁnancial information kept conﬁdential on the server? Hostility may manifest itself in various acts of destruction. For example, malicious software may attempt to format the hard disk of the local machine and if successful all local data will deleted. Other malicious software may attempt to steal conﬁden- tial data from the local machine including bank account or credit card details. One particularly destructive virus is the denial of service attack: this is where a web site
