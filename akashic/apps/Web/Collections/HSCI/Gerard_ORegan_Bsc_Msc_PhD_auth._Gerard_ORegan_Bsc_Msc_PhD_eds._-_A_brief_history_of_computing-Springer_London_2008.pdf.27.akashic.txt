included contributions to reduce geometric problems such as duplicating the cube to algebraic problems. Eventually this led to the use of symbols in the ﬁfteenth century such as: xn · xm = xm+n. 25 The origin of the word “Moor” is from the Greek work μ oo meaning very dark. It referred to the fact that many of the original Moors who came to Spain were from Egypt, Tunisia and other parts of North Africa. 26 The Moorish inﬂuence includes the construction of various castles (alcazar), fortresses (alcalz- aba) and mosques. One of the most striking Islamic sites in Spain is the palace of Alhambra in Granada, and this site represents the zenith of Islamic art. 27 The Catholic Monarchs refer to Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castille who married in 1469. They captured Granada (the last remaining part of Spain controlled by the Moors) in 1492. 28 The origin of the word algorithm is from the name of the Islamic scholar Al-Khwarizmi. 1.7 Chinese and Indian Mathematics 23 The poet Omar Khayyam was also a mathematician. He did work on the classi- ﬁcation of cubic equations with geometric solutions. Others also applied algebra to geometry, and aimed to study curves by using equations. Other scholars made contributions to the theory of numbers: e.g., a theorem that allows pairs of amicable numbers to be found. Amicable numbers are two numbers such that each is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. They were aware of Wilson’s theory in number theory: i.e., for p prime then p divides (p −1)!+1. This result was proved formally by Lagrange in the eighteenth century. Moorish Spain became a centre of learning, and this led to Islamic and other scholars coming to study in the universities in Spain. This includes scholars such as Averros and Avicenna who provided commentaries on the work of Aristotle. Many texts on Islamic mathematics were translated from Arabic into Latin, and this helped to start the renaissance in learning and mathematics in Europe. 1.7 Chinese and Indian Mathematics The development of mathematics in China was independent of developments in other countries. This was due to the geographical position of China, and its ability to absorb other cultures into its own without changing its own. The development of mathematics in China commenced about 1000 BC. The Chinese approach to math- ematics differed from the Greeks, in that its focus was on problem solving rather than on conducting formal proofs. Hellenistic mathematics employed an axiomatic approach with axioms and rules of deduction. Chinese mathematics was pragmatic, and was concerned with ﬁnding the solution to practical problems such as the cal- endar, the prediction of the positions of the heavenly bodies, land measurement, conducting trade, and the calculation of taxes. The Chinese employed counting boards as mechanical aids for calculation from the fourth century BC. Counting-boards are similar to abaci and are usually made of wood or metal, and contained carved grooves between which beads, pebbles or metal discs were moved. The abacus is a device, usually of wood having a frame that holds rods with freely-sliding beads mounted on them. It is used as a tool to assist calculation, and it is useful for keeping track of the sums, the carrys, and so on of calculations. Early Chinese mathematics was written on bamboo strips and included work on arithmetic and astronomy. The Chinese method of learning and calculation in mathematics was learning by analogy. This involves a person acquiring knowledge from observation of how a problem is solved, and then applying this knowledge for problem-solving to similar kinds of problems. The Chinese had their version of Pythagoras’s Theorem and applied it to prac- tical problems. One well-knowm Chinese mathematical book is the Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. This dates from the thirteenth century and it was used as a textbook for several hundred years. It included the Chinese remainder theorem, the formula for ﬁnding the area of a triangle, as well as showing how polynomial 24 1 Early Civilisations equations (up to degree ten) could be solved. Other Chinese mathematicians showed how geometric problems could be solved by algebra, how roots of polynomials could be solved, how quadratic and simultaneous equations could be solved, and how the area of various geometric shapes such as rectangles, trapezia and circles could be computed. Chinese mathematicians were familiar with the formula to cal- culate the volume of a sphere. The best approximation that the Chinese had of π was 3.14159, and this was obtained by Hui by approximations from inscribing regular polygons with 3×2n sides in a circle. Hui seems to have been familiar with the idea of a limit, as his approximation to π is achieved using an iterative approach with
