limited to a text only channel. Turing’s work on “thinking machines” caused a great deal of public controversy as defenders of traditional values attacked the idea of machine intelligence. Tur- ing’s paper led to a debate concerning the nature of intelligence. There has been no machine developed, to date, that has passed the Turing test. Turing strongly believed that machines would eventually be developed that would stand a good chance of passing the “Turing Test”. He considered the opera- tion of “thought” to be equivalent to the operation of a discrete state machine. Such a machine may be simulated by a program that runs on a single, universal machine, i.e. a computer. Turing viewpoint that a machine will one day pass the Turing Test and be consid- ered intelligent is known as “strong artiﬁcial intelligence”. It states that a computer with the right program would have the mental properties of humans. There are a number of objections to strong AI, and one well-known rebuttal is that of Searle’s Chinese Room argument [Sea:80]. The Chinese Room argument is a thought experiment that is used to demonstrate that a machine will never have the same cognitive qualities as a human. A man is placed into a room into which Chinese writing symbols are given to him. He has the knowledge of what symbol to use to respond to each symbol that is presented to him. However, he has no idea as to what each symbol means. Essentially, he is communicating with the person who is giving the symbols to him, and answering any questions that are posed, without the slightest understanding of what he is doing and what the symbols mean. The closed room has two slots where slot 1 is used to input the Chinese charac- ters. The person in the room has no understanding of what these Chinese characters mean. However, a rulebook is provided that allows new Chinese character to be created from the Chinese characters which have already been input. Slot 2 is used to output the Chinese characters. There are essentially three steps in the process: 1. Chinese characters are entered through slot 1. 2. The rulebook is employed to construct new Chinese characters. 3. Chinese characters are outputted to slot 2. 5.3 The Field of Artiﬁcial Intelligence 159 The process is essentially that of a computer program which has an input; performs a computation based on the input; and then ﬁnally produces an output. Further, the rulebook is such that people outside the room are able to send questions such as “How are you?”. The responses to these questions are provided following the rulebook, and meaningful answers are provided. That is, the computer program simulates a human being who understands Chinese, even though the person has not the slightest understanding of the language. The question “Do you understand Chinese?” could potentially be asked, and the rulebook would be consulted to produce the answer “Yes, of course” that is, despite of the fact that the person inside the room has not the faintest idea of what is going on, it will appear to the person outside the room that the person inside is knowledgeable on Chinese. The person in the room is just following rules without understanding. Searle has essentially constructed a machine which can never be mental. Chang- ing the program essentially means changing the rulebook, and this does not increase understanding. The strong artiﬁcial intelligence thesis states that given the right program, any machine running it would be mental. However, Searle argues that the program for this Chinese room would not understand anything, and that therefore the strong AI thesis must be false. In other words, Searle’s Chinese room argument is a rebuttal of strong AI by showing that a program running on a machine that appears to be intelligent has no understanding whatsoever of the symbols that it is manipulating. That is, given any rulebook (i.e., program), the person would never understand the meanings of those characters that are manipulated. Searle argument essentially states that just because the machine acts like it knows what is going on, it only knows what it is programmed to know. It differs from humans in that it is not aware of the situation like humans are. The question is whether a machine can only do what it is told to do, or whether it may think for itself and have consciousness. Searle’s argument suggests that machines may not have intelligence or consciousness, and the Chinese room argument applies to any Turing equivalent computer simulation. There are several rebuttals of Searle’s position8 and one well-known rebuttal attempt is the “System Reply” argument. This reply argues that if a result asso- ciated with intelligence is produced, then intelligence must be found somewhere in the system. The proponents of this argument draw an analogy between the human brain and its constituents. None of its constituents have intelligence but the system as a whole (i.e., the brain) exhibits intelligence. Similarly, the parts of the Chinese
