model. G¨odel proved that ﬁrst order predicate calculus is complete. i.e., all truths in the predicate calculus can be proved in the language of the calculus. Deﬁnition 2.3 (Completeness) A formal system is complete if all the truths in the system can be derived from the axioms and rules of inference. G¨odel showed in 1930 that ﬁst order arithmetic was incomplete: i.e., there are truths in ﬁrst-order arithmetic that cannot be proved in the language of the axioma- tization of ﬁrst-order arithmetic. There are ﬁrst-order theories that are decideable. However, ﬁrst-order logic that includes Peano’s axioms of arithmetic cannot be decided by an algorithm. 2.5 Turing Alan Turing (Fig. 2.10) was a British mathematician who made fundamental con- tributions to mathematics and computer science. In his short but highly produc- tive life he made contributions to computability, cryptology, the breaking of the Enigma naval codes, theoretical work on Turing machines, practical work in the development of the ﬁrst stored program computer in England, and contributions to the emerging ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence with the Turing Test. He was born in London 1912 and his father worked as a magistrate and tax col- lector in the Indian civil service. He attended the Sherbone14 which was a famous public school in England. The school was very strong in the classics rather than in science and mathematics. Turing’s interests were in science, mathematics and chess and he was weak in writing and literature. Turing applied himself to solv- ing advanced problems in science and mathematics, and this included studying Einstein’s work on relativity. Turing excelled at long-distance running at the Sherbone, and in later life he completed the marathon in 2 hours and 46 minutes. This time would have made him a candidate for the 1948 Olympic games that were held in Wembley stadium in London. However, unfortunately he was injured shortly before the games, and this prevented him from future competition. Turing had few close friends at school with the exception of Christopher Morcom who was a gifted student. They worked closely together on science experiments and mathematics. Turing Morcom died of Tuberculosis three years later. Turing attended Kings College, Cambridge from 1931 to 1934, and he graduated with a distinguished degree. He was elected a fellow of Kings College in 1935, and the computer room at King’s college is named after him. He published a key paper on computability in 1936. This paper introduced a theoretical machine known as the Turing machine, and this mathematical machine is capable of performing 14 The Sherbone is located in Dorset, England. Its origins go back to the 8th century when the school was linked with the Benedictine Abbey in the town. 48 2 Foundations Fig. 2.10 Alan Turing any conceivable mathematical problem that has an algorithm. The Church-Turing thesis that states that anything that may be computed may be computed by a Turing machine. There are other equivalent deﬁnitions of computability such as Church’s lambda calculus. 2.5.1 Turing Machines A Turing machine consists of a head and a potentially inﬁnite tape (Fig. 2.11) that is divided into frames. Each frame on the tape may be either blank or printed with a symbol from a ﬁnite alphabet of symbols. The input tape may initially be blank or have a ﬁnite number of frames containing symbols. At any step, the head can read the contents of a frame. The head may erase a symbol on the tape, leave it unchanged, or replace it with another symbol. It may then move one position to the right, one position to the left, or not at all. If the frame is blank, the head can either leave the frame blank or print one of the symbols. Turing believed that every calculation could be done by a human with ﬁnite equipment and with an unlimited supply of paper to write on. The unlimited supply of paper is formalised in the Turing machine by a paper tape marked off in squares. 2.5 Turing 49 Fig. 2.11 Potentially inﬁnite tape The ﬁnite number of conﬁgurations of the Turing machine were intended to repre- sent the ﬁnite states of mind of a human calculator. Deﬁnition 2.4 (Turing Machine) A Turing machine M = (Q, , b, , , q0, F) is a 7-tuple as deﬁned formally in [HoU:79] where: r Q is a ﬁnite set of states. r  is a ﬁnite set of the tape alphabet/symbols.
