these messages were then transmitted by the Germans to their submarines in the Atlantic or their bases throughout Europe. These messages contained top-secret information on German submarine and naval activities in the Atlantic, and the threat that they posed to British and Allied shipping. The team at Bletchey Park succeeded in breaking of the Enigma codes, 15 However, Turing machines are in my view more intuitive than the lambda calculus. 16 Alonzo Church was a famous American mathematician and logician who developed the lambda calculus. He also showed that Peano arithmetic and ﬁrst order logic were undecidable. Lambda cal- culus is equivalent to Turing machines and whatever may be computed is computable by Lambda calculus or a Turing machine. This is known as the Church-Turing Thesis. 2.5 Turing 51 Fig. 2.12 The Enigma machine Courtesy of Wikipedia. and therefore saved many Allied lives in the Atlantic. This contributed to the Allied victory and the shortening of the war. Turing worked in Hut 8 in the codebreaking centre at Bletchey Park which was located in north-west London. He designed an electromechanical machine known as the bombe (Fig. 2.13), and this machine was designed to help break the Enigma codes by ﬁnding the right settings for the Enigma machine. This became the main tool to read the Enigma trafﬁc during the war. It was ﬁrst installed in early 1940, and by the end of the war over 200 bombes were in operation. The bombe weighed over a ton and it was named after a cryptological device designed in 1938 by the Polish cryptologist Marian Rejewski. A standard Enigma machine employed a set of three rotors. Each rotor could be in any of 26 positions. The bombe tried each possible rotor position and applied a test. The test eliminated almost all the 17,576 positions (i.e., 263) and left a smaller number of cases to be dealt with. The test required the cryptologist to 52 2 Foundations Fig. 2.13 Cardboard replica of bombe Courtesy of Wikipedia. have a suitable “crib”: i.e., a section of ciphertext for which he could guess the corresponding plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors, the bombe employed the crib to perform a chain of logical deductions. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred; it then ruled out that setting and moved onto the next. Most of the possible settings would lead to contradictions and could then be discarded. This would leave only a few settings to be investigated in detail. Turing and the team at Bletchey Park made fundamental contributions to breaking the German Enigma machine. Turing was engaged brieﬂy to Joan Clarke who was a co-worker at Bletchey Park. However, their engagement ended by mutual agreement as Turing was a homosex- ual. He travelled to the United States in late 1942 and worked with US cryptanalysts on bombe construction. He also worked with Bell Labs to assist with the develop- ment of secure speech. He returned to Bletchley Park in early 1943 and designed a portable machine for secure voice communications. It was developed too late to be used in the war. Turing was awarded the Order of the British Empire17 (OBE) in 1945 in recognition of his wartime services to Britain. Turing worked as a scientiﬁc ofﬁcer at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) after the war, and he worked on the design of the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) (Fig. 2.14). This was the ﬁrst complete design of a stored-program computer in Britain. The ENIAC had been developed in the United States, and this was a huge machine that did numerical calculations. The ACE computer was intended to be a smaller and more advanced computer than ENIAC. However, there were delays with funding to start the project and Turing became disillusioned with NPL. He moved to the Uni- 17 Of course, the British Empire was essentially over at the end of the second-world war with the United States becoming the major power in the world both economically and militarily. India achieved independence in 1947 and former colonies gradually declared independence from Britain in the coming years. The Irish Free State was awarded dominion status in 1921 after the Irish war of independence. It remained neutral during the second-world war and became a republic in 1949. 2.5 Turing 53 Fig. 2.14 NPL Pilot ACE Courtesy of NPL c⃝Crown Copyright 1950. versity on Manchester to work on the software for the Manchester Mark 1 computer. He also did some work on a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. 2.5.3 Turing Test in AI
