Robots can also improve the quality of life for workers as they can free human workers from performing dangerous or repetitive jobs. Further, it leads to work for robot technicians and engineers. Robots provide consistently high-quality products and can work tirelessly 24 hours a day. This helps to reduce the costs of manufac- tured goods thereby beneﬁting consumers. They do not require annual leave but will, of course, from time to time require servicing by engineers or technicians. However, there are impacts on workers whose jobs are displaced by robots. 5.11 Neural Networks The term “neural network” (artiﬁcial or biological) refers to an interconnected group of processing elements called nodes or neurons. These neurons cooperate and work together to produce an output function. Neural networks may be artiﬁcial or biolog- ical. A biological network is part of the human brain, whereas an artiﬁcial neural network is designed to mimic some properties of a biological neural network. The processing of information by a neural network is done in parallel rather than in series. A unique property of a neural network is fault tolerance: i.e., it can still perform (within certain tolerance levels) its overall function even if some of its neurons are not functioning. There are trainable neural network systems that can learn to solve complex problems from a set of examples. These systems may also use the acquired knowledge to generalise and solve unforeseen problems. A biological neural network is composed of billions of neurons (or nerve cells). A single neuron may be physically connected to thousands of other neurons, and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may be extremely large. The human brain consists of many billions of neurons, and these are organized into a complex intercommunicating network. The connections are formed through axons23 to dendrites,24 and the neurons can pass electrical signals to each other. These connections are not just the binary digital signals of on or off, and instead the connections have varying strength which allows the inﬂuence of a given neuron on one of its neighbors to vary from very weak to very strong. That is, each connection has an individual weight (or number) associated with it that indicates its strength. Each neuron sends its output value to all other neurons to which it has an outgoing connection. The output of one neuron can inﬂuence the activations of other neurons causing them to ﬁre. The neuron receiving the connec- tions calculates its activation by taking a weighted sum of the input signals. The output is determined by the activation function based on this activation. Networks learn by changing the weights of the connections. Many aspects of brain function, especially the learning process, are closely associated with the adjustment of these connection strengths. Brain activity is represented by particular patterns of ﬁring 23 These are essentially the transmission lines of the nervous system. They are microscopic in diameter and conduct electrical impulses. 24 Dendrites are in effect the cell body and extend like the branches of a tree. The origin of the word dendrite is from the Greek word for tree. 5.12 Expert Systems 173 activity amongst the network of neurons. This simultaneous cooperative behavior of a huge number of simple processing units is at the heart of the computational power of the human brain Artiﬁcial neural networks aims to simulate various properties of biological neural networks. These are computers whose architecture is modeled on the brain. They consist of many hundreds of simple processing units which are wired together in a complex communication network. Each unit or node is a simpliﬁed model of a real neuron which ﬁres25 if it receives a sufﬁciently strong input signal from the other nodes to which it is connected. The strength of these connections may be varied in order for the network to perform different tasks corresponding to different patterns of node ﬁring activity. The objective is to solve a particular problem, and artiﬁcial neural networks have been successfully applied to speech recognition problems, image analysis, and so on. Many of the existing artiﬁcial neural networks are based on statistical estimation and control theory. Artiﬁcial neural networks have also been applied to the cognitive modelling ﬁeld. There are similarities between the human brain and a very powerful computer with advanced parallel processing. Artiﬁcial neural networks have provided simpli- ﬁed models of the neural processing that takes place in the brain. The challenge for the ﬁeld is to determine what properties individual neural elements should have to produce something useful representing intelligence. Neural networks are quite distinct from the traditional von Neumann architec- ture26 described in Chapter 2. The latter is based on the sequential execution of machine instructions. The origins of neural networks lie in the attempts to model information processing in biological systems. This relies more on parallel process- ing as well as on implicit instructions based on pattern recognition from sense perceptions of the external world. The nodes in an artiﬁcial neural network are
