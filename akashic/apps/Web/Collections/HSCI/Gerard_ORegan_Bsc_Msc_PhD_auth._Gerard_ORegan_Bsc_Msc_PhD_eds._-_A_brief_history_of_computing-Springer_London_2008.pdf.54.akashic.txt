supercomputing tasks. These include climate modeling, simulations of the solar system, modelling the trajectories of artiﬁcial satellites, and simulation of automo- bile crash dynamics. It was initially weak at handling input and output, which was important to business computing. This led to the development of the COBOL programming language by Grace Murray Hopper5 and others in the late 1950s (Fig. 3.1). The Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) was the ﬁrst business programming language, and it was introduced in 1959. It was developed by a group of computer professionals called the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). The objective of the language was to improve the readability of software source code, and the statements in the language are similar to English. It has a very English- like grammar, and it was designed to make it easier for the average business user to learn the language. The only data types in the language were numbers and strings of text. The language allowed for these to be grouped into arrays and records, so that Fig. 3.1 Grace Murray Hopper United States Government archives. 5 Mary Hopper was a programmer on the Mark 1, Mark II and Mark III and UNIVAC 1 computers. She was the technical advisor to the CODASYL committee. 80 3 Computer Programming Languages data could be tracked and organized better. For example, the operation of division is performed by the verbose statement: ‘DIVIDE A BY B GIVING C REMAINDER D’. In PASCAL, the equivalent statement would be: C := A div B D := A mod B COBOL was the ﬁrst computer language whose use was mandated by the US Department of Defense. The language remains in use today (almost 50 years later), and there is also an object-oriented version of COBOL. 3.3.2 ALGOL ALGOL (short for ALGOrithmic Language) is a family of imperative program- ming languages. It was originally developed in the mid-1950s and was subsequently revised in ALGOL 60, and ALGOL 68. The language was designed by a committee of American and European computer scientists to address some of the problems with the Fortran programming language. It had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on later pro- gramming language design. ALGOL 60 [Nau:60] was the most popular member of the family, and Edsger Dijkstra developed an early ALGOL 60 compiler. John Backus developed a method for describing the syntax of the ALGOL 58 program- ming language. This was revised and expanded by Peter Naur for ALGOL 60, and the resulting approach is known as Backus Naur form (or BNF). The introduction of BNF for deﬁning the syntax or programming languages was a major contribution of ALGOL-60. ALGOL includes data structures and block structures. Block structures were designed to allow blocks of statements to be created (e.g., for procedures or functions). A variable deﬁned within a block may be used within the block but is out of scope outside of the block. ALGOL 60 introduced two ways of passing parameters to subprograms, and these are call by value and call by name. The call by value parameter passing tech- nique involves the evaluation of the arguments of a function or procedure before the function or procedure is entered. The values of the arguments are passed to the function or procedure, and any changes to the arguments within the called function or procedure have no effect on the actual arguments. The call by name parameter passing technique is the default parameter passing technique in ALGOL 60. This involves re-evaluating the actual parameter expression each time the formal param- eter is read. Call by name is used today in C/C++ macro expansion. 3.3 Imperative Programming Languages 81 ALGOL 60 includes conditional statements (if ...then ...else) and iterative statements. It also includes the concept of recursion that allows a function or pro- cedure to call itself. ALGOL has a relatively small number of basic constructs and a set of rules for combining those constructs. Other features of the language include: r Dynamic arrays: These are arrays in which the subscript range is speciﬁed by variables. The size of the array is set at the time that storage is allocated. r Reserved words: These are keywords that are not allowed to be used as identiﬁers by the programmer. r User deﬁned data types: These allow the user to design their own data types that ﬁt particular problems closely. r ALGOL uses bracketed statement blocks and it was the ﬁrst language to use begin end pairs for delimiting blocks. ALGOL was used mainly by researchers in the United States and Europe. There
