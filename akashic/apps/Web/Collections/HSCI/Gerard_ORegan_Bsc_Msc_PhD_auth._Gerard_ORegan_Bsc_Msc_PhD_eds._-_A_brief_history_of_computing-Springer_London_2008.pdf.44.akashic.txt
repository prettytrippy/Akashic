in the equations representing the various switches and relays in the circuit. He devel- oped a calculus for manipulating the equations and this calculus is analogous to Boole’s propositional logic. The design of a circuit consists of writing the algebraic equations that describe the circuit, and the equations are manipulated to yield the simplest circuit. The circuit may then be immediately drawn. At any given time the switching circuit Xab between two terminals a and b is either open (inﬁnite impendence with Xab = 1) or closed (zero impendence with Xab = 0). The symbol 0 is employed to denote the hindrance of a closed circuit and the symbol 1 is used to denoted the hindrance of an open circuit. The expression Xab is denoted pictorially in Fig. 2.16: Fig. 2.16 Open circuit a b Xab 58 2 Foundations For two circuits Xab and Ycd the expression Xab + Ycd denotes the hindrance of the circuit formed when the circuit ab is joined serially to the circuit cd. Similarly, the expression Xab rYcd denotes the hindrance of the circuit formed when the circuit ab is joined in parallel to the circuit cd. The circuit formed by joining two circuits serially is described pictorially in Fig. 2.17: Fig. 2.17 Serial circuits a b Xab c d Ycd = Xab + Ycd This will usually be written as X + Y as it is more common to write the symbols X,Y instead of Xab and Ycd. . Similarly, the circuit formed by joining two circuits in parallel is described pictorially in Fig. 2.18.

Additive Identity (0) 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1 An open circuit in series with a closed circuit (in either order) is an open circuit. Multiplicative Identity (1) 1 r0 = 0 r1 = 0 A closed circuit in parallel with an open circuit (in either order) is a closed circuit. Additive Identity (0) 0 + 0 = 0 A closed circuit in series with a closed circuit is a closed circuit. Multiplicative Identity (1) 1 r1 = 1 An open circuit in parallel with an open circuit is an open circuit. At any given time the circuit is either open or closed: i.e., X = 0 or X = 1.

It yields the following properties (Table 2.10). Table 2.10 Properties of circuits (contd.)

(Generalised) (X rY r. . . .)′ = X′ + Y′ + . . . . Functions of variables may also be deﬁned in the calculus in terms of the “+”, “ r” and negation operations. For example, the function f (X,Y,Z) = XY′ + X′Z′ + XZ′ is an example of a function in the calculus and it describes a circuit. 2.6.1.2 Analogy Circuits and Boolean Logic
