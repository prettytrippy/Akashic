gramming and debugging of these computers was difﬁcult. Further, communication between computers was virtually non-existent. However, several computer scientists had dreams of world wide networks of computers, where every computer around the globe is interconnected to all of the other computers in the world. For example, Licklider1 wrote memos in the early 1960s on his concept of an intergalactic network. This concept envisaged that every- one around the globe would be interconnected and able to access programs and data at any site from anywhere. The United States Department of Defence founded the Advance Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the late 1950s. ARPA embraced high-risk, high-return research and laid the foundation for what became ARPANET and later the internet. Licklider became the ﬁrst head of the computer research program at ARPA, which was called the Information Processing Techniques Ofﬁce (IPTO). He developed close links with MIT, UCLA, and BBN Technologies2 and started work on his vision. Various groups, including National Physical Laboratory (NPL), the RAND Corporation and MIT, commenced work on packet switching networks. The concept of packet switching was invented by Donald Davies3 at the NPL in 1965. The early computers had different standards for representing data and this meant that the data standard of each computer would need to be known for effective com- munication to take place. There was a need to establish a standard for data represen- tation, and a United States government committee developed the ANSII (American 1 Licklider was an early pioneer of AI and he also formulated the idea of a global computer net- work. He wrote his inﬂuential paper “Man–Computer Symbiosis” in 1960, and this paper outlined the need for simple interaction between users and computers. 2 BBN Technologies (originally Bolt Beranek and Newman) is a research and development high technology company. It is especially famous for its work in the development of packet switching for the ARPANET and the Internet. It also did defense work for DARPA. BBN played an important part in the implementation and operation of ARPANET. The “@” sign used in an email address was a BBN innovation. 3 Packet switching is a fast message communication system between computers. Long messages are split into packets which are then sent separately so as to minimise the risk of congestion. Davies also worked on the ACE computer (one of the earliest stored program computers) that was developed at the NPL in the UK in the late 1940s. 182 6 The Internet Revolution Standard Code for Information Interchange) in 1963. This became the ﬁrst universal standard for data for computers, and it allowed machines from different manufac- turers to exchange data. The standard allowed 7-bit binary strings to stand for a letter in the English alphabet, an Arabic numeral or a punctuation symbols. The use of 7 bits allowed 128 distinct characters to be represented. The development of the IBM-360 mainframe standardised the use of 8-bits for a word, and 12-bit or 36-bit words became obsolete. The ﬁrst wide-area network connection was created in 1965. It involved the connection of a computer at MIT to a computer in Santa Monica via a dedicated telephone line. This result showed that telephone lines could be used for the transfer of data although they were expensive in their use of bandwidth. The need to build a network of computers became apparent to ARPA in the mid-1960s, and this led to work commencing on the ARPANET project in 1966. The plan was to implement a packet switched network based on the theoretical work done on packet switching done at NPL and MIT. The goal was to have a network speed of 56 Kbps. ARPANET was to become the world’s ﬁrst packet switched network. BBN Technologies was awarded the contract to implement the network. Two nodes were planned for the network initially and the goal was to eventually have nineteen nodes. The ﬁrst two nodes were based at UCLA and SRI. The network management was performed by interconnected “Interface Message Processors” (IMPs) in front of the major computers. Each site had a team to produce the software to allow its computers and the IMP to communicate. The IMPs eventually evolved to become the network routers that are used today. The team at UCLA called itself the Network Working Group, and saw its role as developing the Network Control Protocol (NCP). This was essentially a rule book that speciﬁed how the computers on the network should communicate. The ﬁrst host to host connection was made between a computer in UCLA and a computer in SRI in late 1969. Several other nodes were added to the network until it reached its target of 19 nodes in 1971. The Network Working Group developed the
