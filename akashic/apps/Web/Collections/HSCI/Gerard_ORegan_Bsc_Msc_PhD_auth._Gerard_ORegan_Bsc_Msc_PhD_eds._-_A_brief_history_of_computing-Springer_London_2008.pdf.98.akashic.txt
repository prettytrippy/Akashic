Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley15 and Hume. Locke argued that a child’s mind is a blank slate (tabula rasa) at birth, and that all knowledge is gained by sense experience. Berkeley (Fig. 5.3) considered the frame problem: i.e., the fact that as we move around a particular object its perspective changes, and yet we as humans still manage to recognise it as the same object. This problem is relevant in machine vision in AI. Fig. 5.3 George Berkely Bishop of Cloyne 14 I think, therefore I am. 15 Berkeley was an Irish philosopher (not British). He was born in Dysart castle in Kilkenny, Ireland; educated at Trinity College, Dublin; and served as bishop of Cloyne in Co. Cork. He planned to establish a seminary in Bermuda for the sons of colonists in America, but the project failed due to lack of funding from the British government. Berkeley University in San Francisco is named after him. 162 5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Expert Systems Berkeley appealed to ideas like the soul to unify the various appearances of the chair as the observer moves around the room, and to God to keep in existence things that were not being perceived.16 Berkely argued that the ideas in a man’s mind have no existence outside his mind [Ber:99], and this philosophical position is known as Idealism. David Hume formulated the standard empiricist philosophical position in his book “An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding” [Hum:06], and this was published in 1748. Hume (Fig. 5.4) distinguished between ideas and impressions. The term “impres- sion” means the lively perceptions that a human directly experiences when hear- ing, seeing, experiencing anger, and so on. Ideas are less lively perceptions and are experienced when reﬂecting on sensations such as hearing, seeing and so on. Hume argued that every idea is copied from some impression, and that it is not possible for an idea to arise without its corresponding impression. Hume identiﬁed three relations between ideas: resemblance (i.e., similarity), contiguity (experienced together or otherwise) in time or space, and cause or effect. The empiricist position formulated by Hume argued that all objects of human knowledge may be divided into two kinds (Table 5.1): Table 5.1 Humes theory of empiricism Kind of knowledge Description Relations of Ideas These include the truths of propositions in Geometry, Algebra and Arithmetic. They are demonstrated by abstract reasoning through the operation of the human mind. These truths are independent of the outside world, and their denial leads to a contradiction. Matter of Fact The evidence for the truth of this kind of knowledge is not as conclusive as knowledge gained through relations of ideas. These truths may not be demonstrated (logically) to be true, and the denial of these propositions does not lead to a contradiction. The evidence for these truths is generally based on experience, and cause and effect. There is a chain of reasons for believing that a particular proposition is true, and these reasons are based on experience. Hume argued that all knowledge consists of either matters of fact or proposi- tions that may be demonstrated (such as geometry) via deduction reasoning in the operations of the mind. 16 Berkeley’s theory of Ontology is that for an entity to exist it must be perceived: i.e., “Esse est percipi”. He argues that “It is an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men, that houses, mountains, rivers, and in a world all sensible objects have an existence natural or real, distinct from being perceived”. This led to a famous Limerick that poked fun at Berkeley’s theory. “There once was a man who said God; Must think it exceedingly odd; To ﬁnd that this tree, continues to be; When there is no one around in the Quad”. The reply to this Limerick was appropriately: “Dear sir, your astonishments odd; I am always around in the Quad; And that’s why this tree will continue to be; Since observed by, yours faithfully, God”. 5.4 Philosophy and AI 163 Fig. 5.4 David Hume The denial or a matter of fact does not involve a contradiction, and matter of fact propositions may be demonstrated by arguments based on experience or cause and effect. They are based entirely based on experience, and experience provides insight into the nature and bounds of cause and effect, and enables the existence of one object to be inferred from that of another. Hume [Hum:06] argued that any subject17 proclaiming knowledge that does not adhere to these empiricist principles should be committed to the ﬂames18 as such knowledge contains nothing but sophistry and illusion. Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason [Kan:03] was published in 1781 and is a response
