follows the link, and purchases a product on Amazon they receive a commission from the company. The on-line auction web site eBay was founded in California by Pierre Omidyar in 1995. Omiyar was a French–American programmer who was born in Paris. He moved to the United States with his parents, and later studied computing. He worked a programmer at Claris prior to setting up eBay. The eBay site brings buyers and sellers together, and it allows buyers to bid for items. The company earns revenue by charging a commission for each transaction, and it is a proﬁtable company. The IPO of eBay took place in 1998 and was highly successful. Millions of items, for example, computers, furniture, cars and collectibles are listed, bought and sold on eBay every day. Anything that is legal and does not vio- late the company’s terms of service may be bought or sold on the site. The sellers on eBay are individuals and also large international companies who are selling their products and services. A buyer makes a bid for a product or service, and competes against several other bidders. The highest bid is successful, and payment and deliv- ery is then arranged. The revenue earned by eBay is generated in a number of ways. There are fees to list a product and fees that are applied whenever a product is sold. The company is international with a presence in over twenty countries. There have been a number of strange offerings on eBay. For example, one man offered one of his kidneys for auction as part of the market for human organs. Other unusual cases have been towns that have been offered for sale (as a joke). Any 192 6 The Internet Revolution product lists that violate eBay’s terms of service are removed from the site as soon as the company is aware of them. The company also has a fraud prevention mechanism which allows buyers and sellers to provide feedback on each other, and to rate each other following the transaction. The feedback may be positive, negative or neutral, and comments may be included as appropriate. This offers a way to help to reduce fraud with unscrupulous sellers or buyers as they will receive negative ratings and comments. ETrade.com was launched in 1996 and it allows investors the facility to purchase shares electronically, and it also provides ﬁnancial information to clients. Price- line was founded by Jay Walker, and offered a service to airlines and hotels to sell unﬁlled seats or rooms cheaply. Priceline was valued at $10 billion at its IPO. This was despite the fact that unlike airlines it had no assets, and was actually selling ﬂights at a loss. 6.7.1 Dot Com Failures Several of companies formed during the dot com era were successful and remain in business today. Others had appalling business models or poor management and failed in a spectacular fashion. This section considers some of the dot com failures and highlights the reasons for failure. Webvan.com was an on-line grocery business that was based in California. It delivered products to a customer’s home within a 30-minute period of their choos- ing. The company expanded to several other cities before it went bankrupt in 2001. Most of the failings at Webvan were due to management as the business model itself was ﬁne. None of the management had experience of the supermarket or grocery business, and the company spent far too much on its infrastructure too quickly, and it rapidly ran out of funding. Its investors had advised the company to build up an infrastructure to deliver groceries as quickly as possible, rather than developing partnerships with existing supermarkets. It built warehouses, purchased a ﬂeet of delivery vehicles and top of the range computer infrastructure before it ran out of money. Boo.com was founded in 1998 by Ernst Malmsten, Kajsa Leander and Patrik Hedel. It was an on-line fashion retailer based in the United Kingdom. The company went bankrupt in 2000 and it succeeded in wasting over $135 million in shareholder funds in less than 3 years. The company web site was poorly designed for its target audience, and it went against many of the accepted usability conventions of the time. The site was designed in the days before broadband, and the designers of the site assumed that its users would employ 56 K modems. The web site included the latest Java and Flash technologies, and it took several minutes to load the ﬁrst page of the web site for most users for the ﬁrst released version of the site. Further, the navigation of the web site was inconsistent, and changed as the user moved around the site. The net effect was that users were turned off the site, and despite extensive advertising by the company, users were not inclined to use the site. 6.7 Dot Com Companies 193 Other reasons for failure included poor management and leadership, lack of direction, lack of communication between departments, spirally costs left unchecked, hiring staff and contractors in large numbers leading to crippling pay
