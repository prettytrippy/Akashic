Page 25 What Eddington says about the 'direction of time' & the principle of entropy amounts to saying that time would reverse its direction if people began one day to walk backwards.

MS 112 232: 22.11.1931 Page 26 The real achievement of a Copernicus or a Darwin was not the discovery of a true theory but of a fertile new point of view. MS 112 233: 22.11.1931 Page 26 I believe that what Goethe was really seeking was not a physiological but a psychological theory of colours. MS 112 255: 26.11.1931 Page 26 Philosophers who say: "after death a timeless state will supervene", or "at death a timeless state supervenes" & do not notice that they have used in a temporal sense 40 the words "after" & "at" & "supervenes" & that temporality is embedded in their grammar. MS 113 80: 29.2.1932 Page 26 Remember the impression made by good architecture, that it expresses a thought. One would like to respond to it too with a gesture. MS 156a 25r: ca. 1932-1934 Page 26 Don't play with what lies deep in another person! MS 156a 30v: ca. 1932-1934 Page 26 The face is the soul of the body. MS 156a 49r: ca. 1932-1934 Page 26 One cannot view†b one's own character from outside any more than one's own handwriting. I have a one-sided relation to my handwriting that prevents me from seeing & comparing it with the writing of others on the same footing. MS 156a 49v: ca. 1932-1934 Page 26 In art it is hard to say anything, that is as good as: saying nothing. MS 156a 57r: ca. 1932-1934 Page Break 27 My thinking, like everyone's, has sticking to it the shrivelled husks†a of my earlier (withered) thoughts.

Compared with the diverse character of words MS 156b 23v: ca. 1932-1934 Page 27 41 If one wanted to characterize the essence of Mendelssohn's music one could do it by saying that there is perhaps no music by Mendelssohn that is hard to understand. MS 156b 24v: ca. 1932-1934 Page 27 Every artist has been influenced by others & shows (the) traces of that influence in his works; but what we get from him is all the same only his own personality†b. What is inherited from others can be nothing but egg shells. We should treat the fact of their presence with indulgence but they will not give us Spiritual nourishment. Page 27 It seems to me (sometimes) as though I were already†c philosophizing with toothless gums & as though I took speaking without teeth for the right way, the more worthwhile way. I detect something similar in Kraus. Instead of my recognizing it as a deterioration. MS 156b 32r: ca. 1932-1934 Page 27 If someone says, let's suppose, "A's eyes have a more beautiful expression than B's", then I want to say that he certainly does not mean by the word beautiful what is common to everything that we call "beautiful". Rather he is playing a game with this word that has quite narrow bounds. But what shows this? Did I have in mind some particular restricted explanation of the word "beautiful"?
