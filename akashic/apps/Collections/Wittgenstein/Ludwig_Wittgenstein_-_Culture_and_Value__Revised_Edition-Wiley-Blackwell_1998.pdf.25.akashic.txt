counterpoint. He may have found a conventional relation Page Break 47 to it yet feel perhaps that it is not his. That it is not clear what the importance of counterpoint to him ought to be. (I was thinking of Schubert in this connection; of his still wanting to take lessons in counterpoint at the end of his life. I think his aim may have been not simply learning more counterpoint, but rather determining where he stood in relation to it.) MS 163 25r: 4.7.1941 Page 47 Wagner's motifs might be called musical prose sentences. And just as there is such a thing as "rhyming prose", so too these motifs can certainly be put together into melodic form, but without their constituting one melody. Page 47 Wagnerian drama too is not drama, but a stringing together of situations as if on a thread, which for its part is only cleverly spun but not, like the motifs & situations, inspired. MS 163 34r: 7.7.1941 Page 47 Don't let yourself be guided by the example of others, but by nature! MS 163 39r c: 8.7.1941 62 Page 47 The language used by philosophers is already deformed, as though by shoes that are too tight. MS 163 47v: 11.7.1941 Page 47 The characters in a drama arouse our sympathy, they are like people we know, often like people we love or hate: The characters in the second part of Faust don't arouse our sympathy at all! We don't feel as though we knew them. They file past us like thoughts not like human beings. MS 163 64v c: 6.9.1941 Page 47 The mathematician (Pascal) who admires the beauty of a theorem in number theory†a; it is as though he were admiring some natural beauty. It's wonderful, he says, what splendid properties numbers have. It's as though he were admiring the conformity to laws of a crystal†b. Page 47 One might say: what splendid laws the Creator has built into numbers! Page Break 48 Page 48 You can't construct clouds. And that is why the future you dream of never comes true. Page 48 Before there was an aeroplane people dreamed about aeroplanes & what a world with them would look like. But, as the reality was nothing like this dream, so we have no reason to believe that reality will develop in the way we dream. For our dreams are full of tinsel, like paper hats & costumes. MS 125 2v: 4.1.1942 or later Page 48 The popular scientific writings of our scientists are not the expression of hard work but of resting on their laurels.†a†b†30 Page 48 If you already have someone's love, no sacrifice is too high a price to pay for it but any sacrifice is too great†c to buy it. MS 125 21r: 1942 63 Page 48 Virtually as there is such a thing as a deep & a shallow sleep, there are thoughts which occur deep within one & thoughts which romp about on the surface. MS 125 42r: 1942 Page 48 You cannot draw the seed up out of the earth. You can only give it warmth†d, moisture & light & then it must grow. (You mustn't even touch†e it except with care.) MS 125 44r: 1942 Page 48 What is pretty cannot be beautiful.------ MS 125 58r: 1942 Page 48 Someone is imprisoned in a room if the door is unlocked, opens inwards; but it doesn't occur to him to pull, rather than push against it. Page 48 Put someone in the wrong atmosphere & nothing will function as it should. He will seem unhealthy in every part. Bring him back into his right element, & everything will blossom and look healthy. But if he is not in his Page Break 49 right element, what then? Well he just has to make the best of looking like a cripple. Page 49 If white turns to black some say: "Essentially it is still the same". And others, if the colour becomes†a one degree darker, say "It has changed completely." MS 125 58v: 18.5.1942 Page 49 Architecture is a gesture. Not every purposive movement of the human body is a gesture. Just as little as every functional building is architecture. MS 126 15r: 28.10.1942 Page 49 64 At present we are combatting a trend. But this trend will die out, superseded by others. And then people will no longer understand our arguments against it; will
