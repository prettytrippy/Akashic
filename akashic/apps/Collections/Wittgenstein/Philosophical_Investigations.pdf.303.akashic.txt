but vorstellt is Wittgenstein’s term, and ‘imagines’ preserves continuity with §517. 258 Notes to PI 151e–8e §524(c) The note in double parentheses is apparently a reminder to insert a remark apropos this theme (which is an inversion of §464). §534(c) The double parentheses suggest that Wittgenstein was undecided whether this remark should occur here or in §525. §537 ‘Then perhaps I say, “I don’t know what it would mean if this is a courageous face”’: the German runs ‘Ich sage dann etwa: “Ich weiß nicht was das hieße, wenn dieses Gesicht ein mutiges Gesicht ist.” Anscombe translated the cited remark as “I don’t know what it would be for this to be a courageous face”. But in MS 115, 23, Wittgenstein added parentheses to this sentence as follows ‘[Diesen Satz kann man nicht richtig stellen indem man statt “wenn” “daß” setzt, oder statt  “ist” “wäre”]’. That is, Wittgenstein explains that this sentence is not tantamount to either ‘I don’t know what it would mean to say that this is a courageous face’ or ‘I don’t know what it would mean if this were a courageous face’. Boxed remarks beween §549 and §550: these two remarks do not occur in the two surviving typescripts of the Investigations. They occur in the ﬁrst two editions at the foot of p. 147, which runs from §548 to §552. (a) derives from MS 110, 103 and 106 (BT 162); (b) from MS 110, 133 (also MS 114, 157). §559 ‘((Meaning-bodies.))’: this is apparently a note for Wittgenstein to insert a remark concerning the ‘meaning-body’ conception of signiﬁcant combinatorial possibilities of words. The idea was that we are inclined to think that the use of a word ﬂows from its meaning, that because it has the meaning it has, it can enter into just these signiﬁcant combinatorial possibilities and not others. It is as if each word presented a single coloured surface, behind which was a colourless glass geomet- rical solid (cube, pyramid, etc.) that enabled the word to combine  with certain words but not others, so that we could make a visible  and signiﬁcant picture only by means of words the meaning-bodies  of which ﬁt together.

Waismann, The Principles of Linguistic Philosophy (Macmillan and St Martin’s Press, London  and New York, 1965), pp. 234–9; TS 302, 4f.; Gordon Baker, ed.,  Voices of Wittgenstein (Routledge, London, 2003), pp. 133–41. For  examples of such a conception see Waismann Principles of Linguistic Philosophy, p. 234 n., where he cites Frege’s Basic Laws of Arithmetic, Notes to PI 158e–63e 259 vol. ii, §§91, 158. This citation is derived from Wittgenstein’s dictation to Waismann in Voices of Wittgenstein, p. 135, where Basic Laws, vol. ii, §207, is also cited. Other passages in Frege which Wittgenstein would not have known, but which bear out his remarks, are to be found in ‘Logic in Mathematics’, repr. in Posthumous Writings (Blackwell, Oxford, 1979), p. 225, and ‘Foundations of Geometry I’, repr. in Collected Papers on Mathematics, Logic, and Philosophy, p. 281. §560 ‘“The meaning of a word is what an explanation of its meaning explains”’: this is a self-quotation a see The Big Typescript, p. 34,  where it occurs as the title of ch. 9, and where the ﬁrst remark runs: ‘“Meaning: what an explanation of meaning explains”, that is: Let’s not ask what meaning is, but instead let’s examine what is called “an explanation of meaning”.’ §568(b) ‘((Meaning a a physiognomy))’: a note for Wittgenstein to insert here a remark about the physiognomy of word meaning. In MS 133, 39r, he noted: ‘In the use of a word we see a physiognomy’, and in MS 137, 4b, he cites (in quotation marks) ‘The concept is not only a tech- nique, but also a physiognomy’.
