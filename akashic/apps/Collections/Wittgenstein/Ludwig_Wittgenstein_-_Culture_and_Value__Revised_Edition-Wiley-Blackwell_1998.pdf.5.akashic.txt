It's a good thing I don't let myself be influenced! MS 105 67 c: 1929 Page 3 A good simile refreshes the intellect. MS 105 73 c: 129 Page 3 It is hard to tell someone who is shortsighted how to get to a place. Because you can't say "Look at that church tower ten miles away over there and go in that direction.<"> MS 105 85 c: 1929 Page 3 Just let nature speak & acknowledge only one thing higher than nature, but not what others might think. MS 107 70 c: 1929 Page 3 You get tragedy where the tree, instead of bending, breaks. Tragedy is something unjewish. Mendelssohn is perhaps the most untragic of composers. Tragically holding on, defiantly holding on to a tragic situation in love always seems to me quite alien to my ideal. Does that mean my ideal Page Break 4 is feeble? I cannot & should not judge. If it is feeble then it is bad. I believe that fundamentally I have a gentle & calm ideal. But may God protect my ideal from feebleness & mawkishness! MS 107 72 c: 1929* Page 4 A new word is like a fresh seed thrown on the ground of the discussion. MS 107 82 [[sic, c?]]: 1929 Page 4 Each morning you have to break through the dead rubble afresh so as to reach the living, warm seed. MS 107 82 c: 1929 Page 4 With my full philosophical rucksack I can climb only slowly up the mountain of mathematics. MS 107 97 c: 1929 Page 4 Mendelssohn is not a peak, but a plateau. His Englishness. MS 107 98 c: 1929 16 Page 4 No one can think a thought for me in the way no one can don my hat for me. MS 107 100 c: 1929 Page 4 Anyone who listens to a child's crying with understanding will know that psychic forces, terrible forces, sleep within it, different from anything commonly assumed. Profound rage & pain & lust for destruction. MS 107 116 c: 1929 Page 4 Mendelssohn is like a man who is cheerful only when everything is cheerful anyway, or good only when everyone around him is good, & not self-sufficient like a tree that stands firmly in its place, whatever may be going on around it. I too am like that & tend to be so. MS 107 120 c: 1929 Page 4 My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them. MS 107 130 c: 1929 Page 4 I often wonder whether my cultural ideal is a new one, i.e. contemporary, or whether it comes from the time of Schumann. At least it strikes me as a continuation of that ideal, though not the continuation that actually followed it then. That is to say, the second half of the 19th Century has been left out. This, I ought to say, has happened quite instinctively & and was not the result of reflection. MS 107 156 c: 10.10.1929 Page Break 5 If we think of the world's future, we always mean the place it will get to if it keeps going as we see it going now and it doesn't occur to us that it is not going in a straight line but in a curve & that its direction is constantly changing. MS 107 176 c: 24.10.1929 Page 5 I think good Austrian work (Grillparzer, Lenau, Bruckner, Labor) is particularly hard to understand. There is a sense in which it is subtler than anything else and its truth never leans towards plausibility. MS 107 184 c: 7.11.1929 Page 5 What is Good is Divine too. That, strangely enough, sums up my ethics. 17 Page 5 Only something supernatural can express the Supernatural. MS 107 192 c: 10.11.1929 Page 5 You cannot lead people to the good; you can only lead them to some place or other; the good lies outside the space of facts. MS 107 196: 15.11.1929 Page 5 I recently said to Arvid,â€ 2 after I had been watching a very old film with him in the cinema: A modern film is to an old one as a present-day motor car is to one built 25 years ago. The impression it makes is just as ridiculous and clumsy & the way film-making has improved is comparable to the sort of technical improvement
