the anticipatory intention, the divination is there no more. But as the words that replace it arrive, it welcomes them successively and calls them right if they agree with it, it rejects them and calls them wrong if they do not. It has therefore a nature of its own of the most positive sort, and yet what can we say about it without using words that belong to the later mental facts that replace it? The intention to say so-and-so is the only name it can receive.’ See also vol. i, pp. 673f.: ‘That nascent cerebral excitations can effect consciousness with a sort of sense of the immanence of that which stronger excitations would make us deﬁnitely feel, is obvious from what happens when we seek to remember a name. It tingles, it trembles on the verge, but does not come.’ §306 We have here changed the German text from ‘beim innerlichen Rechnen’ to ‘beim innerlichen Reden’, which corresponds to MS 144, 92 (cp. Last Writings on the Philosophy of Prychology, vol, 1, §865). This also accords better with the adjacent remarks, all of which concern say- ing things silently to oneself, and not speciﬁcally mental arithmetic. Notes to PPF 233e–40e 265 §314, last line ‘((Connection with “pain in someone else’s body”.))’ In the 1930s, Wittgenstein toyed with the idea of the intelligibility of feeling pain in another person’s body (Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle (Blackwell, Oxford, 1967), p. 49; Philosophical Remarks (Blackwell Oxford, 1975), p. 92; The Blue and the Brown Books, pp. 49ff.), on the grounds that the criterion for pain location is where the sufferer points, and it is conceivable that when asked where one has a pain, one might (perhaps with eyes closed) point to someone else’s body. It is unclear what reminder this note is meant to be, in particular whether Wittgenstein wished to reafﬁrm the intelligibility of pain in another’s body (see §302) or, arguably better, to put the supposition on the same level as the statement that a rose has teeth in the mouth of an animal. §322 The reference of ‘es’ in ‘wenn es tatsächlich nicht geschieht’ is unclear. What is probably intended is the ‘talking to myself’ speciﬁed in the last line of the previous remark. So we have added the elucidating phrase ‘and even if I don’t actually talk to myself’. §339 ‘One would sometimes like to say of certainty and conviction . . .’: the German has ‘Von der Sicherheit, vom Glauben möchte man manchmal sagen . . .’, which Anscombe translated ‘We should some- times like to call certainty and belief . . .’. But here Glauben means ‘con- viction’, not ‘belief’. §362 ‘Verstellung ist natürlich nur ein besonderer Fall davon, . . .’: In the context from which this remark is drawn, namely MS 137, 52a–b, it is evident that what is being asserted is not that pretending is a spe- cial case of someone’s producing (say) . . . (as in Anscombe’s transla- tion), but rather that pretending to be in pain, for example, is a special case of. . . .
