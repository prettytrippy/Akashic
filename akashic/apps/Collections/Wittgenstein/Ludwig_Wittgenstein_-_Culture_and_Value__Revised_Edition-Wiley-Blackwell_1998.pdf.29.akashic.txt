but even that does not prove beyond question that what they abominate is to be welcomed. MS 131 66c: 19.8.1946 Page 56 In former times people entered monasteries. Were they perhaps simple-minded, or obtuse people?--Well, if people like that took such measures so as to be able to go 72 on living, the problem cannot be an easy one! MS 131 79 c: 20.8.1946 Page 56 The human being is the best picture of the human soul.†36 MS 131 80:20.8.1946 Page 56 Shakespeare's similes are, in the ordinary sense, bad. So if they are nevertheless good--& I don't know whether they are or not--they must be a law to themselves. Perhaps e.g. their ring makes them convincing & gives them truth. It might be the case that with S. the essential thing is his effortlessness, his arbitrariness, so that if you are to be able really to admire him, you just have to accept him as he is in the way you accept nature, a piece of scenery e.g. If I am right about this, that would mean that the style of his whole work, I mean, of his complete works†a is in this case what is essential, & provides the justification. Page 56 That I do not understand him could then be explained by the fact that I cannot read him with ease. Not, that is, as one views a splendid piece of scenery. MS 131 163:31.8.1946 Page 56 A man sees well enough what he has, but not what he is. What he is can be compared with his height above sea level, which you cannot for the most part judge straight off. And the greatness, or triviality, of a work depends on where its creator stands. Page Break 57 Page 57 But you can equally say: someone who misjudges himself is never great: someone who throws dust in his own eyes. MS 131 176: 1.9.1946 Page 57 How small a thought it takes to fill a whole life! Page 57 73 Just as someone may travel around the same little country throughout his whole life, & think there is nothing outside it! You see everything in a queer perspective (or projection): the country that you ceaselessly keep covering, strikes you as enormously big; the surrounding countries seem to you like narrow border regions.†a MS 131 180: 2.9.1946 Page 57 To go down into the depths you don't need to travel far; you can do it in your own backgarden.†b MS 131 182: 2.9.1946 Page 57 It is very remarkable, that we should be inclined to think of civilization--houses, streets, cars, etc--as separating man from his origin, from the lofty, eternal, etc. Our civilized environment, even its trees & plants, seems to us then cheap, wrapped†c in cellophane, & isolated from everything great & from God as it were. It is a remarkable picture that forces itself on us here. MS 131 186: 3.9.1946 Page 57 My 'achievement' is very much like a mathematician's,†d who invents a new calculus.†e MS 131 218: 8.9.1946 Page 57 If people did not sometimes commit stupidities, nothing intelligent at all would ever happen. MS 131 219: 8.9.1946 Page 57 The purely corporeal can be uncanny. Compare the way†f angels & devils are portrayed. A so-called "miracle" must be connected with this. It must be as it were a sacred gesture. MS 131 221: 8.9.1946 Page Break 58 The way you use the word "God" does not show whom you mean,†a but what you mean. MS 132 8: 11.9.1946 Page 58 In a bullfight the bull is the hero of a tragedy. First driven mad by suffering, he dies a slow & terrible death. MS 132 12: 12.9.1946 74 Page 58 A hero looks death in the face, real death, not just a picture of death. Behaving decently in a crisis does not mean being able to act the part of a hero well, as in the theatre, it means rather being able to look death itself in the eye. For an actor may play a multitude of roles, but in the end it is after all he himself, the human being, who has to die. MS 132 46 c: 22.9.1946 Page 58 What does it consist in: following a musical phrase with understanding? Observing
