The edifice of your pride has to be dismantled. And that means frightful work. MS 157a 57r: 1937 Page 30 In one day you can experience the horrors of hell; that is plenty of time. MS 157a 57r: 1937 44 Page 30 There is a big difference between the effect of a script that you can read fluently & one that you can write but not decipher†a easily. The thoughts are enclosed,†16 as in a casket. MS 157a 58r: 1937 Page 30 The greater "purity" of objects that do not affect the senses, numbers for instance. MS 157a 62v: 1937 Page 30 If you offer a sacrifice & then are conceited about it, you will be cursed along with your†b sacrifice. MS 157a 66v c: 1937 Page 30 The light shed by work is a beautiful light, but it only shines with real beauty if it is illuminated by yet another light. MS 157a 67v c: 1937 Page 30 "Yes, that's how it is," you say, "because that's how it must be!" Page 30 (Schopenhauer: the real life span of the human being is 100 years.) "Of course, it must be like that!" It is as though you have understood a creator's purpose. You have understood the system. You do not ask yourself 'How long do human beings actually live then?', that seems now a superficial matter; whereas you have understood something more profound. MS 157b 9v: 1937 Page 30 The†17 only way namely for us†c to avoid prejudice†18 --or vacuity in our claims, is to posit†d the ideal as what it is, namely as an object of comparison--a measuring rod as it were--within our way of looking at things, & not†e as a preconception to which everything must†f conform. This namely is†g the dogmatism into which philosophy†h can so easily degenerate. Page Break 31 45 But then†19 what is the relation between an approach like Spengler's & mine? Injustice in Spengler: The ideal loses none of its dignity if it is posited as the principle determining the form of one's approach. A good unit of measurement.-- --†20 MS 157b 15v: 1937 Page 31 Slept a bit better. Vivid dreams. A bit depressed; weather & state of health. The solution of the problem you see in life is a way of living which makes what is problematic disappear. The fact that life is problematic means that your life does not fit life's shape. So you must change your life, & once it fits the shape, what is problematic will disappear. But don't we have the feeling that someone who doesn't see a problem there is blind to something important, indeed to what is most important of all? Wouldn't I like to say he is living aimlessly--just blindly like a mole as it were; & if he could only see†a, he would see the problem? Or shouldn't I say: someone who lives rightly does not experience the problem as sorrow, hence not after all as a problem, but rather as joy, that is so to speak as a bright halo round his life, not a murky background. MS 118 17r c: 27.8.1937* Page 31 Almost in the same way as earlier physicists are said to have found suddenly that they had too little mathematical understanding to be able to master physics; we may say that young people today are suddenly in the position that ordinary common sense no longer suffices to meet the strange demands life makes. Everything has become so intricate that for its mastery†b an exceptional degree of understanding is required. For it is not enough any longer to be able to play the game well; but the question is again and again: what sort of game is to be played now anyway?†c MS 118 20r: 27.8.1937 Page 31 There is much that is excellent in Macaulay's essays; only his value judgements on people are tiresome, & superfluous. One would like to say to him: stop gesticulating! & just say what you have to say. MS 118 21v: 27.8.1937 Page Break 32 46 Ideas too sometimes fall from the tree before they are ripe. MS 118 35r c: 29.8.1937 Page 32 In philosophizing it is important for me to keep changing my position, not to stand too long on one leg, so as not to get stiff.
