thing as a sensation of red (that is, no use of ‘sensation’ in ‘sensation of red’ that is analogous to its use in ‘sensation of pain’). The German Empﬁndung is more pliable than the English ‘sensation’, although  even it is being stretched here. The sense of the passages is better con- veyed by ‘impression of red’, which is suggested by Wittgenstein’s use of Farbeindruck (‘colour impression’) in §275 and §276, and both Farbeindruck and visueller Eindruck (‘visual impression’) in §277. §273 The quoted phrase ‘uns Allen Gegenüberstehendes’ is taken from Frege’s discussion of colour predicates in The Basic Laws of Arithmetic, vol. i, preface, p. xviii. Notes to PI 110e–23e 255 §312 ‘Gesichtsempﬁndung’ / ‘Schmerzempﬁndung’: as noted above, ‘Empﬁndung’ is more accommodating than ‘sensation’, but Gesichts- empﬁndung is stretching things to the limits, and perhaps beyond. We have opted for ‘sensation of pain’ / ‘visual impression’ for the sake of clarity, since there are no such things as visual sensations (save for sen- sations of glare). §336 ‘A French politician . . .’: MS 109, 177, suggests that the politician was Briand. §339(a) ‘the Devil took the shadow of Schlemihl from the ground’:  see Adelbert von Chamisso’s tale Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte. English-speaking readers will be more familiar with the sim- ilar conceit in James Barry’s Peter Pan. §339(b) ‘numerals are actual, and numbers are non-actual, objects’:  a reference to Frege’s Basic Laws of Arithmetic, vol. i, Introduction,  p. xviii, where he argues that numerals are actual objects, whereas  numbers are objective but not actual objects. §342 William James’s discussion of Ballard’s reminiscences occurs in The Principles of Psychology (Holt, New York, 1890), vol. i, p. 266. §351 ‘I can reply: “These words . . .”’: we have added the quotation marks here to match the previous quoted sentence. §365 ‘Do Adelheid and the Bishop . . .’: a reference to Goethe’s Götz von Berlichingen, Act II, scene 1, in which the scene opens towards the end of a game of chess between Adelheid and the Bishop. §370 ‘Frage nach dem Wesen der Vorstellung’: Anscombe translated this, perfectly correctly, as ‘the question as to the nature of the imagination’ (for Wittgenstein is not claiming that ‘the imagination’ is deﬁned by a set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions). But the price was to lose con- tact with the next remark (§371): ‘Das Wesen is in der Grammatik aus- gesprochen’, which she translated as ‘Essence is expressed by grammar’. To keep the continuity between §370 and §371, we have trans- lated ‘Frage nach dem Wesen der Vorstellung’ in §370 as ‘question of what imagination essentially is’. §371 We have retained ‘Essence’ for Wesen, since one could hardly say ‘Nature is expressed by grammar’. But it must be borne in mind that 256 Notes to PI 123e–36e Wesen does service for both ‘essence’ and ‘nature’ a thus leaving  the question of whether the concept of the imagination is a family- resemblance concept wide open (see note to §92 above). §373 ‘(Theology as grammar)’: an allusion to a remark Wittgenstein attributed to Luther, who, he says, wrote somewhere that theology is the grammar of the word ‘God’; see Alice Ambrose, ed., Wittgenstein’s Lectures, Cambridge, 1932–1935 (Blackwell, Oxford, 1979), p. 32,  and ‘Movements of Thought: Diaries 1930–1932, 1936–1937’, repr. in translation in James C. Klagge and Alfred Nordmann, eds, Ludwig Wittgenstein b Public and Private Occasions (Rowman & Littleﬁeld Publishers Inc., Lanham, Md., 2003), p. 211 (under 23 Feb. 1937). §400 ‘und man könnte auch sagen, eine neue Empﬁndung: to repeat, Empﬁndung has a far broader extension than ‘sensation’. Anscombe trans- lated this as ‘it might even be called a new sensation’. But this makes
