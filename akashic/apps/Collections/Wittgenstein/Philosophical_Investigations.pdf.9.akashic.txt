ing on the continuation of TS 220. At this stage, the continuation of his reﬂections beyond §189 was intended to pursue questions in the phi- losophy of mathematics pertaining to inference, proof and calculation, and logical compulsion. So the initial discussion of following rules, which is common both to this Early Draft and to the ﬁnal version of the Investigations, was designed to support an investigation into logical and mathematical necessity. The upshot of his work on the sequel to TS 220 was the dictation in 1938 of TS 221, a typescript that corresponds, in a different arrangement (see below), to Part I of the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. It was with the conjunction of TS 220 and 2211 that Wittgenstein approached the Syndics of Cambridge University Press in the late summer of 1938 with the intention of pub- lishing it in a bilingual edition under the title ‘Philosophical Remarks’. However, by October 1938, Wittgenstein was already having qualms about publication and expressing hesitation about it to the Syndics. Sometime between late 1939 and 1943, Wittgenstein revised the Early Draft. One of the typescripts of TS 220 was extensively revised by hand (TS 239).2 TS 221 was reworked, cut up and re-arranged. The subse- quently dictated typescript, TS 222, has been printed as Part I of the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. It was with these revised 1 The conjunction of the two typescripts has been published as the ‘Frühfassung’ (‘Early Draft’) in Philosophische Untersuchungen, Kritisch-genetische Edition, ed. Joachim Schulte (Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2001). 2 It has been published in the critical-genetic edition as the ‘Bearbeitete Frühfassung’ (‘Reworked Early Draft’). xx The Text of the Philosophische Untersuchungen typescripts that Wittgenstein again approached the Syndics of the Press in September 1943, proposing publication of a book with the title Philosophical Investigations, to be printed together with a new impres- sion of the Tractatus. The idea of juxtaposing these two texts, as he explained later in the Preface to the Investigations, had occurred to him in the course of re-reading the Tractatus together with a friend (prob- ably Nicholas Bachtin). For it seemed to him that his new philosoph- ical ideas could be seen in the right light only by contrast with his old ones. The Syndics agreed to the proposal in January 1944, but by then Wittgenstein had already moved on to something else. His next attempt was embodied in a 195-page typescript (which no longer exists as a separate typescript, but which has been reconstructed by G. H. von Wright) consisting of 300 (mis)numbered remarks (303 being the correct number) corresponding roughly to Investigations §§1–421. It was for this typescript that Wittgenstein wrote the Preface to the Investigations dated January 1945. This so called Intermediate Draft3 consists of the reworked draft of TS 220 (i.e. TS 239), cor- responding to Investigations §§1–189(a), together with eight pages from TS 221, corresponding to §§189(b)–197, followed by new material, written in 1944, that corresponds roughly to half the remarks in Investigations §§198–421. It was at this stage that Wittgenstein appar- ently abandoned the idea of a logico-mathematical sequel to the early draft of §§1–189, resolving instead to continue the remarks on follow- ing rules with the discussion of a private language, thought, imagina- tion, and so forth a in short, the material we are now familiar with from the ﬁnal version. The mathematical project was, it seems, deferred for a second book, with the subsequently proposed tentative title of ‘Beginning Mathematics’ (see MS 169, 36v). Still not satisﬁed with what he had done, Wittgenstein turned in mid- 1945 to selecting further materials for this ﬁrst volume,4 i.e. the Investigations, from his manuscript volumes MSS 115–119 and MSS 129–30, some from pre-war sources (MSS 115–17 and 119) and the rest from 1944–5 (the ﬁnal part of MS 116 and MSS 129–30). From these he dictated a typescript he entitled ‘Bemerkungen I’ (MS 228), which con- sists of 698 numbered remarks, some 400 of which he then incorporated 3 Published in the critical-genetic edition as the ‘Zwischenfassung’ (‘Intermediate Draft’). 4
