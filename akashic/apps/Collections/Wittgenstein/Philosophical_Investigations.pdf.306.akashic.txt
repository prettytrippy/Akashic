of ‘visual impression’), and has made matters more rather than less obscure. Although the confusion of ‘impression’ with ‘expression’ was eliminated in MS 144, and presumably in the missing TS 234, the remain- ing confusion of ‘form and colour in the visual impression’ persisted. Notes to PPF 209e–20e 263 §151 ‘Compare a remark of Lewis Carroll’s’: MS 137, 135a, says that the remark is in Alice Through the Looking Glass. The reference is to ch. 1 in which writing in the Looking Glass world is reversed, and can be read only in a mirror, exempliﬁed in the text by reproducing the hand- written ﬁrst verse of ‘Jabberwocky’ in reverse. Of this Alice initially remarks ‘It’s all in a language I don’t know. §153 we have ampliﬁed ‘in a ﬁgure (1) for another ﬁgure (2)’ to  read ‘in a certain ﬁgure (call it Figure 1) for another ﬁgure (call it Figure 2)’ in order to avoid the impression that Wittgenstein is referring to two numbered ﬁgures somewhere in his text. We have adjusted §154 accordingly. §§164 and 165 Anscombe translated ‘eine Form’ in both remarks by the same word, ‘form’. But the two remarks come from separate con- texts, §164 from MS 135, 176, and §165 from MS 135, 42. In the ﬁrst of these remarks, ‘eine Form’ means a mould, but in the second it means a logical form (see Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, vol. 1, §1026). §180(c) The reference to Köhler’s ﬁgure of interpenetrating hexagons may be to his Gestalt Psychology (G. Bell and Sons Ltd, London, 1930), ch. 6. §205 amalgates two remarks in the ﬁrst two editions. The two para- graphs are a single remark in MS 137, 33a–b (cf. Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, vol. 2, §535), the latter being an elaboration on the former. §§220–1 In the ﬁrst two editions §221 was printed before §220. But Wittgenstein’s instruction in MS 144 indicates that their order should be reversed a a change that makes better sense. §231 ‘We react to the facial expression’. The printed German text  here had Gesichtseindruck (‘visual impression’), but it is a misprint, and should read Gesichtsausdruck (‘facial expression’), as is evident from MS 138, 6b (under 21 Jan. 1949) a cf. Last Writings on the Philosophy of Psychology, vol. 1, §744: ‘We react to a hesitant facial expression differently from someone who does not recognize it as hesitant (in the full sense of the word).’ We have accordingly corrected both German and English. 264 Notes to PPF 221e–32e ‘a modiﬁed concept of sensing’: Anscombe had here ‘a modiﬁed  concept of sensation’ (Empﬁndungsbegriff ), but that is wrong. To  recognize a facial expression as timid is not to have a sensation of any kind, but to sense something a to sense the timidity in the person’s face. §§235–6 were originally printed after §247 (as p. 212(b)–(c)) in the ﬁrst two editions). Wittgenstein’s instructions in MS 144 unequivocally indi- cate that they should occur after §234. §§249–50 were run into one remark in the ﬁrst two editions (p. 212(e)). We have separated them, as in MS 138, 10a–b, and MS 144, 74–5. This is the more cogent arrangement. §273, third sentence In place of Anscombe’s addition of ‘we say’ (in the ﬁrst two editions, p. 216(a)), we have added quotation marks to Wittgenstein’s text. §299 James: the reference is perhaps to The Principles of Psychology, vol. i, p. 253: ‘And has the reader never asked himself what kind of mental fact is his intention of saying a thing before he has said it? It is an entirely deﬁnite intention, distinct from all other intentions, an absolutely distinct state of consciousness, therefore; and yet how much of it consists of deﬁnite sensorial images, either of words or of things? Hardly anything! Linger and the words and things come into the mind;
