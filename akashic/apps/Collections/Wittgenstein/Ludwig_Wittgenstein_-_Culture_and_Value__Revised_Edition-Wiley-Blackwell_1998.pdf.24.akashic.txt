Page 44 You can't be reluctant to give up your lie & still tell the truth. MS 117 168 c: 17.2.1940 Page 44 Writing the right style means, setting the carriage precisely†b on the rails. MS 117 225: 2.3.1940 Page 44 If this stone won't budge at present, if it is wedged in, first move other stones around it.-- Page 44 We are only going to set you straight on the track, if your carriage stands on the rails crookedly; driving†c is something we shall leave you to do by yourself.†d MS 117 237: 6.3.1940 Page 44 Scraping away mortar is much easier than moving a stone. Well, you have to do 59 the one, before you can do the other. MS 117 253: 11.3.1940 Page Break 45 What is insidious about the causal approach is that it leads one to say: "Of course,†a that's how it has to†b happen". Whereas one ought to say: It may have happened like that, & in many other ways.†c Page 45 If we use the ethnological approach does that mean we are saying philosophy is ethnology? No it only means we are taking up our position far outside, in order to see the things more objectively. MS 162b 67r: 2.7.1940 Page 45 One of my most important methods is to imagine a historical development of our ideas different from what has†d actually occurred. If we do that the problem shows us a quite new side. MS 162b 68v: 14.8.1940 Page 45 What I am resisting is the concept of an ideal exactness thought as it were to be given us a priori. At different times our ideals of exactness are different; & none of them is preeminent. MS 162b 69v: 19.8.1940 Page 45 It is often only very slightly more disagreeable to tell the truth than a lie; only about as much as is drinking bitter rather than sweet coffee; & yet even then I have a strong inclination to tell the lie. MS 162b 70r: 21.8.1940 Page 45 (My style is like bad musical composition.) Page 45 Don't apologize for anything, don't obscure anything, look & tell how it really is--but you must see something that sheds a new light on the facts. MS 123 112: 1.6.1941 Page 45 Our greatest stupidities may be very wise. MS 124 3 c: 6.6.1941 60 Page 45 It is incredible how helpful a new drawer can be, suitably placed in our filing cabinet. MS 124 25: 11.6.1941 Page 45 You must say something new & yet nothing but what is old. (N.) Page Break 46 You must indeed say only what is old--but all the same something new! Page 46 Different 'interpretations' must correspond to different applications. Page 46 The poet too must always be asking himself: 'is what I am writing really true then?' which does not necessarily mean: 'is this how it happens in reality?'. Page 46 (...) Page 46 It's true you must assemble old material. But for a building.--(W.)†28 MS 124 28: 11.6.1941 Page 46 As we get old the problems slip through our fingers again, as in our youth. It is not just that we cannot crack them open,†a we can't even keep hold of them. MS 124 31: 12.6.1941 Page 46 What a curious attitude scientists have--: "We still don't know that;†b but it is knowable & it is only a question of time till we know it"! As if that went without saying.-- MS 124 49: 16.6.1941 Page 46 I could imagine someone thinking the names "Fortnum" & "Mason"†29 fitted 61 together. MS 124 56: 18.6.1941 Page 46 Don't demand too much, & don't be afraid that your just demand will melt into nothing. MS 124 82: 27.6.1941 Page 46 People who are constantly asking 'why' are like tourists, who stand in front of a building, reading Baedeker, & through reading about the history of the building's construction etc etc are prevented from seeing it. MS 124 93: 3.7.1941 Page 46 Counterpoint might represent an extraordinarily difficult problem for a composer; the problem namely: given my propensities what should be my relation towards
