inaccessible. MS 133 2: 23.10.1946 Page 62 The lesson in a poem is overstated, if the intellectual points are nakedly exposed, not clothed by the heart. MS 133 6: 24.10.1946 Page 62 Oh a key can†38 lie for ever where the locksmith placed it, & never be used to open†b the lock for which the master forged it. MS 133 12: 24.10.1946 Page 62 79 "It is high time for us to compare this phenomenon†c with something different"--one may say.--I am thinking, e.g. of mental illnesses. MS 133 18: 29.10.1946 Page 62 Freud's fanciful pseudo-explanations (just because they are so brilliant) performed a disservice. Page Break 63 Page 63 (Now every ass has them†a within reach for 'explaining' symptoms of illness with their help.) MS 133 21: 31.10.1946 Page 63 Irony in music. E.g. Wagner in the Mastersingers. Incomparably deeper in the first movement of the IXth in the fugato. Here is something, that corresponds to the expression of bitter irony in speech. Page 63 I could equally well have said: the distorted in music. In the sense in which we speak of features distorted by grief. When Grillparzer says Mozart countenanced only the "beautiful" in music, that means, I think, that he did not countenance the distorted, frightful, that there is nothing in his music corresponding to this. I am not saying that is quite true; but assuming it to be so, it is a prejudice on Grillparzer's part, to think that by rights it ought not to be otherwise. The fact that music since Mozart (of course especially through Beethoven) has extended the range of its language is to be neither commended nor deplored, rather: that's how it is.†b Grillparzer's attitude involves a certain ingratitude. Did he want another Mozart? Could he imagine something†39 that such a being might compose? Would he have been able to imagine Mozart if he had not known him? The concept of "the beautiful" has done a lot of mischief here too. Page 63 Concepts may alleviate mischief or make it worse; foster it or check it. MS 133 30: 1.-2.11.1946 Page 63 The fundamental insecurity of life. Misery, everywhere you look. 80 The grinning faces of idiots may, it is true, make us think they do not really suffer; but they do, only not in the same place as the more intelligent. They do not have, as one might say, headache, but as much other wretchedness as anyone else. Not all wretchedness need after all evoke the same facial expression. A nobler person who suffers will look different from me. MS 133 68 c: 12.11.1946* Page 63 I cannot kneel to pray, because it's as though my knees were stiff. I am afraid of dissolution (of my own dissolution) should I become soft. MS 133 82: 24.11.1946 Page Break 64 I am showing my pupils sections of an immense landscape, which they cannot possibly find their way around. MS 133 82: 24.11.1946 Page 64 The truly apocalyptic view of the world is that things do not repeat themselves. It is not e.g. absurd to believe that the scientific & technological age is the beginning of the end for humanity, that the idea of Great Progress is a bedazzlement, along with the idea that the truth will ultimately be known; that there is nothing good or desirable about scientific knowledge & that humanity, in seeking it, is falling into a trap. It is by no means clear that this is not how things are. MS 133 90: 7.1.1947 Page 64 A man's dreams are virtually never realized. MS 133 118: 19.1.1947 Page 64 Socrates, who always reduces the Sophist to silence--does he reduce him to silence rightfully?--It's true, the Sophist does not know what he thinks he knows; but that is no triumph for Socrates. It can neither be a case of "You see! You don't know it!"--nor, triumphantly, "So none of us knows anything!" Because I don't want to think just to convict myself, or even someone else, of unclarity I am not trying to understand something,†a simply in order to see that I still do not understand it.
