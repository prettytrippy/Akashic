very little.] And how do you pay for ideas? I believe: with courage. MS 132 75: 28.9.1946* Page 60 If life becomes hard to bear we think of improvements†c. But the most important & effective improvement,†d in our own attitude, hardly occurs to us, & we can decide on this only with the utmost difficulty.†e MS 132 136: 7.10.1946 Page 60 It's possible to write in a style that is unoriginal in form--like mine--but with well chosen words; or on the other hand in one that is original in form, freshly grown from within oneself. (And also of course in one which is botched together just anyhow out of old furnishings†f.) MS 32 145: 8.10.1946 77 Page Break 61 Amongst other things Christianity says, I believe, that sound doctrines are all useless. That you have to change your life. (Or the direction of your life.) That all wisdom is cold; & that you can no more use it for setting your life to rights, than you can forge iron when it is cold. For a sound doctrine need not seize you; you can follow it, like a doctor's prescription.--But here you have to be seized & turned around by something.--(I.e. this is how I understand it.) Once turned round, you must stay turned round. Wisdom is passionless. By contrast Kierkegaard calls faith a passion. MS 132 167: 11.10.1946 Page 61 Religion is as it were the calm sea bottom at its deepest, remaining calm, however high the waves rise on the surface.-- MS 132 190: 16.10.1946 Page 61 "I never before believed in God"--that I understand. But not: "I never before really believed in Him." MS 132 191: 18.10.1946 Page 61 I often fear madness. Have I any reason to assume that this fear does not spring from, so to speak, an optical illusion: of seeing something as an abyss that is close by, when it isn't? The only experience I know of that speaks for its not being an illusion, is the case of Lenau. For in his "Faust" there are thoughts of a kind I too am familiar with. Lenau puts them into Faust's mouth, but they are no doubt his own about himself. What is important is what Faust says about his loneliness or isolation. Page 61 His talent too strikes me as similar to mine: A lot of froth--but a few fine thoughts. The stories in his Faust are all bad, but the observations often true & great. MS 132 197: 19.10.1946 Page 61 Lenau's Faust is remarkable in that here man has dealings only with the Devil. God does not stir himself. MS 132 202: 20.10.1946 78 Page 61 In my view Bacon was not a precise thinker. He had large, as it were broad, visions But someone who has nothing but these is bound to be generous with promises, inadequate in keeping them. You may envision a flying machine without being precise about its details. Outwardly you may†a imagine it as very similar to a proper aeroplane, & describe its functioning Page Break 62 graphically. Nor is it obvious, that such an invention†a has to be worthless. Perhaps it spurs others to a different sort of work.--So while these others make preparations, a long time in advance as it were, for building an aeroplane that really flies, the former occupies himself with dreaming what this aeroplane has to look like & what it will be capable of. This so far says nothing about the value of these activities. The dreamer's may be worthless--& so may the others. MS 132 205: 22.10.1946 Page 62 Madness doesn't have to be regarded as an illness. Why not as a sudden--more or less sudden--change of character? Everybody is (or most are) mistrustful, & perhaps more so towards their relations, than towards others. Is their any reason for mistrust? Yes & no. Reasons can be given for it, but they are not compelling. Why shouldn't someone suddenly become much more mistrustful of people? Why not much more withdrawn? or devoid of love? Don't people get like this even in the ordinary course of events?--Where is the line to be drawn here between will & ability? Is it that I will not open my heart to anyone any longer, or that I cannot? If so much can lose its attraction, why not everything? If someone is wary even in ordinary life, why shouldn't he--& perhaps suddenly--become much more wary? And much more
