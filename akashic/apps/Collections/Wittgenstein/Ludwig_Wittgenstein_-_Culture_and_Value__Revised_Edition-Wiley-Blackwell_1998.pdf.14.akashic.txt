And insofar as the words of our <language> seem to us the only possible standards of measurement we are always doing him†d injustice. And he is†e first overestimated then underestimated. In this context Spengler is quite right not to classify Weininger with the western philosophers.†f†15 Page 23 Nothing we do can be defended definitively. But only by reference to something else that is established. I.e. no reason can be given why you should act (or should have acted) like this, except that by doing so you bring about such and such a situation, which again you have to accept as an aim. MS 111 195: 13.9.1931 Page 23 The inexpressible (what I find enigmatic & cannot express) perhaps provides the background, against which whatever I was able to express acquires meaning. MS 112 1: 5.10.1931 Page Break 24 Work on philosophy--like work in architecture in many respects--is really more work†a on oneself. On one's own conception. On how one sees things. (And what one expects of them.) MS 112 46: 14.10.1931 Page 24 The philosopher easily gets into the position of an incompetent manager who, instead of doing his own work & simply seeing to it†b that his employees do theirs properly takes over their work & so finds himself one day overloaded with other people's work, while the employees look on and criticize him. MS 112 60: 15.10.1931 Page 24 38 The idea is worn out by now & no longer usable. (I once heard Labor make a similar remark about musical ideas.) In the way silver paper, once crumpled, can never quite be smoothed out again. Nearly all my ideas are a bit crumpled. MS 112 76: 24.10.1931 Page 24 I really do think with my pen, for my head often knows nothing of what my hand is writing. Page 24 (Philosophers are often like little children who first scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and now†c ask the grown-up "what's that?"--It happened like this: The grown-up had often drawn something for the child & said: "this is a man", "this is a house" etc. And now the child makes some marks too and asks: and what's this then?" MS 112 114: 27.10.1931 Page 24 Ramsey was a bourgeois thinker. I.e. he thought with the aim of clearing up the affairs of some particular community. He did not reflect on the essence of the state--or at least he did not like doing so--but on how this state might reasonable be organized. The idea that this state might not be the only possible one partly disquieted him and partly bored him. He wanted to get down as quickly as possible to reflecting on the foundations--of this state. This was what he was good at & what really interested him; whereas real philosophical reflection disquieted him until he put its result (if it had one) on one side as trivial. MS 112 139: 1.11.1931 Page Break 25 A curious analogy could be based on the fact that the eye-piece of even the hugest telescope cannot be bigger†a than our eye. MS 112 153: 11.11.1931 Page 25 Tolstoy: the meaning (importance) of something lies in its being something everyone can understand. That is both true & false. What makes the object hard to understand--if it's significant, important--is not that you have to be instructed in abstruse matters in order to understand it, but the antithesis between understanding the object & what most people want to see. Because of this precisely what is most obvious may be what is most difficult to understand. It is not a difficulty for the intellect but one for the will that has to be overcome. MS 112 221: 22.11.1931 Page 25 39 Someone who teaches philosophy nowadays gives his pupil foods, not†b because they are to his taste, but in order to change his taste. MS 112 223: 22.11.1931 Page 25 I must be nothing more than the mirror in which my reader sees his own thinking with all its deformities & with this assistance can set it in order. MS 112 225: 22.11.1931 Page 25 Language sets everyone the same traps; it is an immense network of well kept†c wrong turnings. And hence we see one person after another walking down the same paths & we know in advance the point at which they will branch off, at which they will walk straight on without noticing the turning, etc., etc. So what I
