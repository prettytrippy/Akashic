reads me, should be seriously influenced thereby in the way he works. (In that respect my warnings†a are like the posters on the ticket offices at English railway stations†42 "Is your journey really necessary?" As if anyone Page Break 71 Page 71 reading that would say to himself "On second thoughts, no"†i.) Quite different artillery is needed here from anything I am in a position to muster. Most likely I could still achieve an effect in that, above all, a whole lot of garbage is written in response to†a my stimulus & that perhaps this provides†b the stimulus for something good. I ought always to hope only for the most indirect of influences. Page 71 E.g. nothing more stupid than the chatter about cause & effect in history books; nothing more wrong-headed, more half-baked.--But who could put a stop to it by saying that? (It is†c as though I wanted to change men's and women's fashions†d by talking.) MS 134 143: 13.-14.4.1947 Page 71 Think about how it was said of Labor's playing "He is speaking". How curious! What was it about this playing that was so reminiscent of speaking? And how remarkable that this†e similarity with speaking is not something we find incidental, but an important & big matter!--We should like to call music, & certainly some music, a language; but no doubt not some music.†f (Not that this need involve a judgement of value!) MS 134 156: 11.5.1947 88 Page 71 The book is full of life--not like a human being, but like an ant-heap. MS 134 157: 11.5.1947 Page 71 One keeps forgetting to go down to the foundations. One doesn't put the question marks deep enough down. Page 71 The labour pains at the birth of new concepts. MS 134 180: 27.6.1947 Page 71 "Wisdom is grey." Life on the other hand & religion are full of colour. MS 134 181: 27.6.1947 Page Break 72 It may be that science & industry, & their progress, are the most enduring thing in the world today. That any guess at a coming collapse of science & industry were†a for now, & for a long time to come, simply a dream, & that science & industry after†43 & with infinite misery will unite the world, I mean integrate it into a single empire, in which†i to be sure peace is the last thing that will then find a home. For science & industry do decide wars, or so it seems. MS 135 14: 14.7.1947 Page 72 Do not interest yourself in what, presumably, only you are doing! MS 135 23: 16.7.1947 Page 72 My thoughts probably move in a far narrower circle than I suspect! MS 135 85: 24.7.1947 Page 72 Thoughts rise to the surface slowly, like bubbles. Page 72 89 Sometimes it's as though you could see a thought, an idea, as an indistinct point far away on the horizon; & then it often comes closer†b with surprising speed. MS 135 101: 26.7.1947 Page 72 Where there is bad management in the state, I believe, bad management is fostered in families too. A worker who is ready for a strike†44 at any time will not bring up his children to respect order either. MS 135 102: 27.7.1947 Page 72 God grant the philosopher insight into what lies in front of everyone's eyes. MS 135 103 c: 27.7.1947 Page 72 Life is like a path along a mountain ridge; right & left smooth†c slopes down which you slide in this or that†d direction without being able to stop yourself. I keep seeing people slip like this & I say: "How could anyone help himself in that situation!" And that is what "denying free will" comes to. That is the attitude that expresses itself in this 'belief'. But it is not a scientific belief, has nothing to do with scientific convictions. Page Break 73 Page 73 Denying responsibility means, not holding anyone responsible. MS 135 110: 28.7.1947 Page 73 Some people have a taste that is related to an educated taste as is the visual impression of a purblind eye to that of a normal eye. Where a normal eye see clear articulation, the weak one sees blurred patches of colour. MS 135 133: 2.8.1947 Page 73 Someone who knows too much finds it hard not to lie. MS 135 191: 17.12.1947 Page 73
