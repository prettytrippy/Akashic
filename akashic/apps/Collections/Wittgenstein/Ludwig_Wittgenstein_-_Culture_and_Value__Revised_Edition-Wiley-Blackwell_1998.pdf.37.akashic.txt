I am so afraid of someone's playing the piano in the house that, when it happens & the strumming has stopped, I still have a sort of hallucination, that it's continuing. I can hear it then quite clearly, although I know that it is all in my imagination. MS 90 135 192: 17.12.1947 Page 73 It appears to me as though a religious belief could only be (something like) passionately committing oneself to a system of coordinates†a. Hence although it's belief, it is really a way of living, or a way of judging life. Passionately taking up this interpretation. And so instructing in a religious belief would have to be portraying, describing that system of reference & at the same time appealing to the conscience. And these together would have to result finally in the one under instruction himself, of his own accord, passionately taking up that system of reference. It would be as though someone were on the one hand to let me see my hopeless situation, on the other depict the rescue-anchor†b, until of my own accord, or at any rate not†c†d led by the hand by the instructor, I were to rush up & seize it.†45 MS 136 16b: 21.12.1947 Page 73 Perhaps one day a culture will arise out of this civilization. Then there will be a real history of the discoveries of the 18th, 19th & 20th centuries, which will be of profound interest. MS 136 18b: 21.12.1947 Page 73 In the course of a scientific investigation we say all kinds of things; we make many utterances the role of which in our investigation we do not Page Break 74 understand. For of course not everything we say has a conscious purpose, but our tongues just keep going. Our thoughts run in established routines, we make, automatically, transitions†a according to the techniques†b we have learned. And now comes the time for us to survey what we have said. We have made a whole lot of movements that do not further our purpose, even impede it, and now we have to clarify our thought processes philosophically. MS 136 31a: 24.12.1947 Page 74 It seems to me I am still a long way from understanding these things; from the point, that is, at which I know what I have to talk about, & what I don't need to talk about. I still keep getting entangled in details without knowing whether I ought to be talking about such things at all; & I have the impression that I may be inspecting a large area, simply to exclude it eventually from consideration. But even in this case these reflections would not be worthless; as long, that is, as they are not just going round in a circle.

MS 136 51a: 3.1.1948 Page Break 75 Genius is talent in which character makes itself heard. For that reason, I would like to say, Kraus has talent, an extraordinary talent, but not genius. To be sure, there are flashes of genius where, despite the great application of talent, you do not notice the talent. Example: "For the ox & the ass can do things too..."†46 It is curious that this e.g. is so much greater than anything Kraus ever wrote. Here you see not merely an intellectual skeleton, but a whole human being. That is the reason too why the greatness of what someone writes depends on everything else he writes & does. MS 136 59a: 4.1.1948 Page 75 92 In a dream, & even long after we wake up, dream words can seem to us to have the greatest significance. Isn't the same illusion possible too in waking life? It seems to me as though I am sometimes subject to it these days. It often appears to be like this with the insane.
