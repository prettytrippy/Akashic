A language, which is spoken in strict tempo, so that you can also speak according to the metronome. It does not go without saying that music can be performed, like ours, at least occasionally, to the metronome. (Playing the theme from the 8th Symph.†52 exactly according to the metronome.) MS 137 97b: 14.11.1948 Page 85 It would already be enough, that all members of a community had the same facial features, for us not to be able to fathom them. MS 137 97b: 16.11.1948 Page Break 86 If a false thought is so much as expressed boldly & clearly, a great deal has already been gained. MS 137 100a: 19.11.1948 Page 86 103 Only by thinking much more crazily even than the philosophers, can you solve their problems. MS 137 102a: 20.11.1948 Page 86 Imagine someone watching a pendulum & thinking: God makes it move like that. Well, doesn't God have the right†a even to act in accordance with a calculation? Page 86 A writer far more talented than I would still have little talent. MS 137 104a: 21.11.1948 Page 86 Human beings have a physical need to tell themselves when at work: "Let's have done with it now", & it's having constantly to go on thinking in the face of this need when philosophizing, that makes this work so strenuous. MS 137 104b: 22.11.1948 Page 86 You must accept the faults in your own style. Almost like the blemishes in your own face. MS 137 106b: 23.11.1948 Page 86 Always come down from the barren heights of cleverness into the green valleys of folly. MS 137 111b: 28.11.1948 Page 86 I have one of those talents that has constantly to make a virtue out of necessity. Page 86 Tradition is not something that anyone†b can pick up†c, it's not a thread, that someone can pick up, if & when he pleases; any more than you can choose your own ancestors.†d Someone who has no tradition & would like to have it, is like an unhappy lover. Page 86 The happy lover & the unhappy lover both have their particular pathos. But it is harder to bear yourself well as an unhappy lover than as a happy one. MS 137 112b: 29.11.1948 104 Page Break 87 Moore poked into a philosophical wasp nest with his paradox; & if the wasps did not duly fly out, that's only because they were too listless. MS 137 120a: 10.12.1948 Page 87 In the realm of the mind a project can usually not be begun again, nor should it be. These thoughts fertilize the soil for fresh thoughts.†a MS 137 122a: 11.12.1948 Page 87 Are you a bad philosopher then, if what you write is hard to understand. If you were better, then you would make it easy to understand what is difficult.--But who says that is possible?! [Tolstoy] MS 137 127a: 16.12.1948 Page 87 The greatest happiness for a human being is love. Suppose you say of the schizophrenic: he does not love, he cannot love, he refuses to love--where is the difference? Page 87 "He refuses to..." means: it is in his power. And who wants to say that?! Page 87 Well, of what do we say "it is in his power"?--We say it in cases where we want to draw a distinction. I can lift this weight, but I will not lift it; that weight I cannot lift. Page 87 "God has commanded it, therefore we must be able to do it." That means nothing. There is no "therefore" about it. The two expressions might at most mean the same. Page 87 "He has commanded it" means here roughly: He will punish anyone who does not do it. And nothing follows from that about being able. And that is the sense of 'election by grace'. Page 87 But that does not mean that it is right to say: "He punishes, although we cannot 105 act otherwise."--Perhaps, though, one might say: here there is punishment, where punishment by human beings would be impermissible. And the whole concept of 'punishment' changes here. For the old illustrations can no longer be applied, or now have to be applied quite differently. Just look at an allegory like "The Pilgrim's Progress"†53 & see how nothing Page Break 88
