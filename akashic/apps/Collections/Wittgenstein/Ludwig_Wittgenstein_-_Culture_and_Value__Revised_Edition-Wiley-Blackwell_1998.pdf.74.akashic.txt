234 †i Wittgenstein's alternative versions, "in dem" or "in welchem", do not correspond to any distinction in English. Page 74 †i This could also be rendered as "the former chaos". Page 76 †i The German text plays on the two congnate verbs "anregt" (= "stimulates") "aufregt" (= exasperates). Page 81 †i This is the idiomatic phrase corresponding to the German. However, the reader's attention is drawn to two points. [1] "Cussedness" here translates the German "Tücke", which in other contexts sounds rather stronger than would "cussedness" in English. In this passage, therefore, outside the context of the particular idiom it has been rendered as "malice". [2] The plural "things" corresponds to the German singular "des Objekts". This may be important insofar as Wittgenstein interprets the idiomatic phrase under discussion as implying a demonic intervention in particular cases; whereas, in English at least, the phrase is quite compatible with the conception Wittgenstein here develops in opposition to such an implication. Page 84 †i The justification for translating the variants thus is the slenderest imaginable... Page 90 †i I am reading "U.u." as an idiosyncratic version of "U.U." (= "Unter Umständen"). It has been suggested to me that it could stand for "Und umgekehrt". However, (a) "And vice versa" seems to make little sense applied to the preceding sentence; and (b) "U.u." is not a recognized abbreviation for "Und umgekehrt"--in Germany at least; I am not sure about Austria. Page 93 †i In the German 'Rast' (= 'rest') and 'Hast' (= 'haste'). Page 95 †i Literally: "No human being must must" Page 97 †i "Craving" is too strong for "Verlangen" in this context; "desire" is too weak. The vulgarism "hankering" strikes me as just right. 235 236
