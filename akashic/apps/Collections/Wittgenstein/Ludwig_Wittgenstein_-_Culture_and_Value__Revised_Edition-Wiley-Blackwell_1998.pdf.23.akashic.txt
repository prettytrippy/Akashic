My originality (if that is the right word) is, I believe, an originality that belongs to the soil, not the seed. (Perhaps I have no seed of my own.) Sow a seed in my soil, & it will grow differently than it would in any other soil. Freud's originality too was like this, I think. I have always believed--without knowing why--that the original seed of psychoanalysis was due to Breuer, not Freud. Of course Breuer's seed-grain can only have been quite tiny. (Courage is always original.) Page 42 People nowadays think, scientists are there to instruct them, poets, musicians etc. to entertain them. That the latter have something to teach them; that never occurs to them. Page 42 Piano playing, a dance of human fingers. MS 162b 59v: 1939-1940 Page 42 Shakespeare, one might say, displays the dance of human passions. For this reason he has to be objective, otherwise he would not so much display the dance of human passions--as perhaps talk about it. But he shows us them in a dance, not naturalistically. (I got this idea from Paul Engelmann.) MS 162b 61r: 1939-1940 Page 42 The comparisons of the N.T.†i leave room for as much depth of interpretation†a as you like. They are bottomless.†b Page Break 43 57 They have less style than the first speech of a child. Even a work of supreme art has something that can be called 'style', yes even something that can be called 'fashion'. MS 162b 63r: 1939-1940 Page 43 Within all great art there is a WILD animal: tamed. Not, e.g., in Mendelssohn. All great art has primitive human drives as its ground bass. They are not the melody (as they are, perhaps, in Wagner), but they are what gives the melody depth†a & power. In this sense one may call Mendelssohn a 'reproductive' artist.-- In the same sense: my house for Gretl†25 is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear, good manners, the expression of great understanding (for a culture, etc.). But primordial life, wild life striving to erupt into the open--is lacking. And so you might say,†b health is lacking (Kierkegaard). (Hothouse plant.) MS 122 175 c: 10.1.1940 Page 43 A teacher who can show good, or indeed†c astounding results while he is teaching, is still not on that account a good teacher, for it may be that, while his pupils are under his immediate influence, he raises them to a level which is not natural to them, without developing their own capacities for work at this level, so that they immediately decline again once the teacher leaves the schoolroom. Perhaps this holds for me; I have thought about this. (When Mahler was himself conducting, his private performances†26 were excellent; the orchestra seemed to collapse at once if†d he was not conducting it himself.) MS 122 190 c: 13.1.1940 Page 43 'The aim of music: to communicate feelings.' Connected with this: We may rightly say "he has†e now the same face as before"--although measurement gave different results in the two cases. How are the words "the same facial expression" used?--How do we know that someone is using these words correctly? But how do I know that I am using them correctly? MS 122 235: 1.2.1940 Page 43 Not funk but funk conquered is what is worthy of admiration & makes life 58 Page Break 44 worth having been lived. Courage, not cleverness; not even inspiration, is the grain of mustard that grows up to be a great tree. To the extent there is courage, there is connection with life & death. (I was thinking of Labor's & Mendelssohn's organ music.) But it is not by recognizing the want of courage in someone else, that you acquire courage yourself. MS 117 151 c: 4.2.1940 Page 44 One might say: "Genius is courage in one's talent". MS 117 152 c: 4.2.1940 Page 44 Try to be loved & not-admired.†27 MS 117 153 c: 4.2.1940 Page 44 Sometimes you have to take an expression out of the language,†a to send it for cleaning,--& then you can put it back into circulation. MS 117 156: 5.2.1940 Page 44 How hard it is for me to see what is right in front of my eyes! MS 117 160 c: 10.2.1940
