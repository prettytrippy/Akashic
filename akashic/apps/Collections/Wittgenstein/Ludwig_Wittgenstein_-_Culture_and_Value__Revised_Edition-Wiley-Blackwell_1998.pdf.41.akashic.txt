that presupposes humility & an enormous capacity for suffering, strength then. And anyone who in addition can express himself perfectly, simply addresses us in the language of a great human being. MS 137 40b: 28.5.1948 Page 81 I think that present day education of human beings†49 aims at decreasing the capacity for suffering. Nowadays a school counts as good, if the children have a Good time. And formerly that was not the yardstick. And parents would like children to become the way they themselves are (only more so) & yet they give them an education which is quite different from their own.--Capacity for suffering is not rated highly, since there are not supposed to be any sufferings, really they are out of date. Page 81 "The cussedness of things"†i--An unnecessary anthropomorphism. We might speak of a malice of the world; easily imagine the devil created the Page Break 82 world, or part of it. And we need not imagine the demon intervening in particular situations; everything may happen 'in accordance with the laws of nature': it is just that the whole plan is directed at evil from the start. But a human being exists in this world in which things break, slide about, cause every possible mischief. And of course he†a is one of the things.--The 'malice' of the object is a stupid anthropomorphism. For the truth is much graver than this fiction. MS 137 42a: 30.5.1948 Page 82 A stylistic device may be useful & yet I may be barred from using it. Schopenhauer's "as which" e.g. It would sometimes make for much more 99 comfortable, clearer expression, but cannot be used by someone who perceives it as archaic; & he must not disregard this perception†b. MS 137 43a: 30.5.1948 Page 82 Religious faith & superstition are quite different. The one springs from fear & is a sort of false science. The other is a trusting. MS 137 48b: 4.6.1948 Page 82 It would almost be strange if there did not exist animals with the mental life of plants. I.e. lacking mental life. MS 137 49a: 4.6.1948 Page 82 I think it might be regarded as a fundamental law of natural history that, whenever something in nature 'has a function', 'serves a purpose', the same thing also occurs in circumstances where it serves none, is even 'dysfunctional'. If dreams sometimes protect sleep, you can count on their sometimes disturbing it; if dream hallucination sometimes serves a plausible end (imagined†c wish fulfilment), count on its doing the opposite as well. There is no 'dynamic theory of dreams'. MS 137 49b: 4.6.1948 Page 82 What is important about depicting anomalies precisely? If you cannot do it, that†d shows you do not know your way around the concepts. MS 137 51a: 15.6.1948 Page Break 83 I am too soft, too weak, & so too lazy, to achieve anything important. The industry of the great is, amongst other things, a sign of their strength, quite apart from their inner wealth. MS 137 54b: 25.6.1948 Page 83 If God really does choose those who are to be saved, there is no reason why he should not choose them according to their nationalities, races, or temperaments. Why the choice should not be expressed in the laws of nature. (He was of course also able so to choose, that the choice follows a law.) I have been reading extracts from the writings of St. John of the Cross†50, in which it is written that people have gone to their ruin, because they did not have the good fortune to find a wise spiritual director at the right moment. 100 And how can you†a say then that God does not try people beyond their strengths? I am inclined to say here, it is true, that crooked concepts have done a lot of mischief, but the truth is, that I do not know at all, what does good & what does mischief. MS 137 57a: 26.6.1948 Page 83 We must not forget: even our more refined, more philosophical, scruples have a foundation in instinct. E.g. the 'We can never know...' Remaining receptive to further arguments. People who couldn't be taught this would strike us as mentally inferior. Still incapable of forming a certain concept. MS 137 57b: 30.6.1948 Page 83 If the dreams of sleep have a similar function to daydreams, then they partly serve <to> prepare people for any eventuality (including the worst). MS 137 65b:
