doing <">. And I can imagine that the mere report of the words & life of a saint can make someone believe the reports that the trees bowed. But I am not so impressed. Page 52 When I came home I expected a surprise & there was no surprise for me, so, of course, I was surprised. MS 128 46: ca. 1944 Page 52 Go on, believe! It does no harm. Page 52 'Believing' means, submitting to an authority. Having once submitted to it, you cannot then, without rebelling against it, first call it in question & then once again find it convincing. Page 52 A cry of distress cannot be greater than that of one human being. Page 52 Or again no distress can be greater than what a single person can suffer. Hence one human being can be in infinite distress & so need infinite help. The Christian religion is only for the one who needs infinite help, that is only for the one who suffers infinite distress. Page 52 The whole Earth cannot be in greater distress than one soul. Page 52 68 Christian faith--so I believe--is refuge in this ultimate distress. Someone to whom it is given in such distress to open his heart instead of contracting it, absorbs the remedy into his heart. Someone who in this way opens his heart to God in remorseful confession opens it for others too. He thereby loses his dignity as someone special†a & so becomes like a child. That means without office, dignity & aloofness from others. You can open yourself to others only out of a particular kind of love. Which acknowledges as it were that we are all wicked children. Page 52 It might also be said: hate between human beings comes from our cutting ourselves off from each other. Because we don't want anyone else to see inside us, since it's not a pretty sight in there. Page Break 53 Page 53 Of course you must continue to feel ashamed of what's within you, but not ashamed of yourself before your fellow human beings. Page 53 There is no greater distress to be felt than that of One human being. For if someone feels himself lost, that is the ultimate distress. MS 128 49: ca. 1944 Page 53 Words are deeds.†32 MS 179 20: ca. 1945 Page 53 Only someone very unhappy has the right to pity someone else. MS 179 26: ca. 1945 Page 53 It isn't reasonable to be furious even at Hitler; let alone at God. MS 179 27: ca. 1945 Page 53 When people have died we see their life in a conciliatory light. His life looks 69 well-rounded through a haze. For him it was not well-rounded however, but jagged & incomplete. For him there was no conciliation; his life is naked & wretched. MS 180a 30: ca. 1945 Page 53 It is as though I had lost my way & asked someone the way home. He says he will show me and walks with me along a nice smooth path. This suddenly comes to an end. And now my friend says: "All you have to do now is to find the rest of the way home from here.<">†33 MS 180a 67: ca. 1945 Page 53 The less somebody knows & understands himself the less great he is, however great may be his talent. For this reason our scientists are not great. For this reason Freud, Spengler, Kraus, Einstein are not great. MS 130 239: 1.8.1946* Page 53 Schubert is irreligious & melancholy. MS 130 283: 5.8.1946 Page 53 Are all people great human beings? No.--Well then, what hope can you have of being a great human being! Why should something be given you that is not given your fellows? To what purpose?!--If it isn't your wish to be rich that makes you think you are rich, then it must be some observation some experience that shows you it! And what experience do you have (except that of vanity)? Simply that you have a talent. And my conceit of Page Break 54 being an extraordinary human being is of course much older than my experience, of my particular talent. MS 130 291 c: 9.8.1946 Page 54 Schubert's melodies can be said to be full of climaxes, & this cannot be said of Mozart's; Schubert is baroque. You can point to particular places in a Schubert melody & say: look, that is the point of this melody, this is where the idea comes to a head. Page 54 The melodies of different composers can be approached by applying the principle:
