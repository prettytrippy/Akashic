§571(b) ‘and the psychologist observes the utterances [Äusserungen] (the behaviour) of the subject’: Anscombe here translated Äusserungen as ‘external reactions’. This is unsatisfactory. She translated a comparable passage in PPF, §28(b) (PI Part II, p. 179) ‘What do psychologists record? a What do they observe? Isn’t it the behaviour of human beings, in particular their utterances [Äusserungen]?’ We have opted for ‘utterances’ here too, in order to ensure consistency between these two, related remarks. §589 ‘(Luther: “Faith is under the left nipple.”)’: This, as suggested by Eike von Savigny (Wittgensteins “Philosophische Untersuchungen b Ein Kommentar für Leser, 2nd edn (Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main, 1996), vol. 2, p. 273), is probably a reference to Luther’s sermon of 27 Dec. 1533: ‘Es ligt nicht am euserlichen leben, sed unter dem lincken zitzen, das man wisse Christum esse Salvatorem’ (Dr Martin Luther’s Werke, Kritische Gesamtausgabe (H. Böhlaus Nachfolger, Weimar), vol. 37 (1910), p. 248), or his fourth sermon on Christmas Day 1544: ‘Denn das du ein Christ seyest und Gott wolgefallest, solches ist nicht am eusserlichen leben gelegen, sonder unter dem lincken zuzen und im hertzen . . .’ (ibid., vol. 52 (1915), pp. 63f.) 260 Notes to PI 166e–73e §606(b) ‘((“A quite particular expression”))’: which of the many remarks on this theme Wittgenstein had in mind here is unclear. The theme is discussed in The Blue and Brown Books (Blackwell, Oxford, 1958), pp. 170–7 (see also MSS 120, 253; 130, 45; 150, 2f.). §609(b) Wittgenstein discussed the idea of understanding as ‘an atmo- sphere’, and its apparently indescribable character in extenso in The Blue and Brown Books, pp. 144–85 (see especially pp. 155–7); see also MS 162(b), 56(r)ff. Which part of these extensive discussions he had in  mind here is unknown. The quoted phrase ‘An indescribable character’ is probably an allusion to James, The Principles of Psychology, e.g.  vol. i, pp. 251ff. §610(b) ‘((I should like to say: “These . . .”))’: It is unclear why this remark is enclosed in double parentheses. The reference to James is prob- ably to The Principles of Psychology, vol. i, p. 251, where he remarks, ‘our psychological vocabulary is wholly inadequate’, to capture the inde- scribable difference between trying to recall A’s name and trying to recall B’s name. §611(a) ‘“Willing a wanting a too is merely an experience”’: the German reads ‘“Das Wollen ist auch nur eine Erfahrung”’, which Anscombe translated as ‘“Willing too is merely an experience”’. Wollen, however, serves both for ‘willing’ and for ‘wanting’, and to translate it and its cognates (in the sequel) uniformly by ‘will’ and ‘willing’ (as Anscombe did) can be misleading. By inserting ‘a wanting a’ we have tried to make it clear that Wittgenstein is speaking of wanting to do something (as in §613), as well as about philosophical conceptions of will and idea. The idiom of ‘will’ and ‘idea’ referred to in parentheses in the ﬁrst sentence is Schopenhauer’s, although Schopenhauer, unlike the British empiricists, insisted on the categorial distinctness of will and idea (representation). §618(a) The reference to Augustine is to Confessions, Bk VIII, §8. §621(b) It is unclear what this parenthetical note refers to. Note that neither James nor Russell argued that the kinaesthetic sensations are the willing, but, if anything, the idea of the normally associated kinaes- thetic sensations a which allegedly causes the appropriate muscular con- tractions involved in a voluntary movement. §639 ‘Meaning something, one wants to say, develops’: the German runs: ‘Die Meinung, möchte man sagen, entwickelt sich.’ Strictly speaking, Notes to PI 175e–PPF 198e 261 Anscombe’s translation, ‘One would like to say that an opinion de-
