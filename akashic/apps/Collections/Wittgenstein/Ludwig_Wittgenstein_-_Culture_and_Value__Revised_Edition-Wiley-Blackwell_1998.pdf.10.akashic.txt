I am sure that Bruckner composed just in his head, imagining the orchestra playing, Brahms with his pen. Of course this is an oversimplification. But it does highlight one feature. MS 153a 127v: 1931 Page 14 A tragedy might really always start with the words: "Nothing at all would have happened, had it not been that..." Page 14 (Had he not been caught in the machine by a corner of his clothing?) Page 14 But isn't it a one-sided view of tragedy to think of it merely as showing, that an encounter can decide one's whole life. Page 14 I think today there could be a form of theatre played in masks. The characters would be just stylized human beings.†c†6 In Kraus's writings this can be clearly seen. His pieces could be, or should be, performed in masks. Of course this goes with a certain abstractness in these works. And masked theatre, as I believe, is in any case the expression of an intellectual character. Perhaps (too) for this reason only Jews will be attracted to this theatre. MS 153a 128v: 1931 Frida Schanz: 27 Foggy day. Grey autumn haunts us. Laughter seems tainted; Page Break 15 the world is mute today, as though last night it died. In the red-gold hedge are brewing fog dragons; and sleeping lies the day. The day will not awaken. (...) I took the poem on the previous page from a "Rösselsprung"†i in which of course the punctuation was not shown. So I do not know if the words "Foggy day" form the title, or belong to the first line, as I have written it. And it is remarkable how trivial the poem sounds if it does not begin with "Foggy day" but with "Grey". This changes the rhythm of the whole poem.†a MS 153a 136r: 1931 Page 15 What you have achieved cannot mean†b more to others than to you. Page 15 As much (as) it has cost you, that is what they will pay. MS 153a 141r: 1931 Page 15 The Jew is a desert region under whose thin layer of rock lies the molten lava of spirit. MS 153a 160v: 1931 Page 15 Grillparzer: "How easy it is to move about in broad distant regions, how hard to grasp what is individual & near at hand..." MS 153b 3r: 1931 28 Page 15 How should we feel if we had never heard of Christ? Should we feel left alone in the dark? Do we not feel like that only in the way a child doesn't when he knows there is someone in the room with him? Religious madness is madness springing from irreligiousness. MS 153b 29r: 1931 Page 15 I look at the photographs of Corsican brigands and reflect: these faces are too hard & mine too soft for Christianity to be able to write on them. The Page Break 16 faces of the brigands are terrible to behold & yet they are certainly no more distant from a good life & are simply situated on a different side of it than am I. MS 153b 39v: 1931 Page 16 A confession has to be part of one's new life. MS 154 1r: 1931 Page 16 I never more than half succeed in expressing what I want to express. Indeed not even so much,†7 but perhaps only one tenth. That must mean something. My writing is often nothing but "stammering". MS 154 1v: 1931 Page 16 The saint is the only Jewish "genius". Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance.) Page 16 I think there is some truth in my idea that I am really only reproductive in my thinking. I think I have never invented a line of thinking but that it was always provided for me by someone else & I have done no more than passionately take it up for my work of clarification. That is how Boltzmann Hertz Schopenhauer Frege, Russell, Kraus, Loos Weininger Spengler, Sraffa†8 have influenced me. Can one take Breuer & Freud as an example of Jewish reproductive 29 thinking?--What I invent are new comparisons. Page 16 At the time I modelled the head for Drobil too the stimulus was essentially a work of Drobil's & my work was again really one of clarification. I believe that what is essential is for the activity of clarification to be carried out with COURAGE; without this it becomes a mere clever game. Page 16 The Jew must in a real sense "make nothing his business".†i But for him especially
