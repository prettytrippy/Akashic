Doesn't e.g. Freud†a do that when he calls even an anxiety dream a wish-fulfilment dream? Where is the difference? In the scientific approach the new use is justified through a theory. And if this theory is false then the new extended use has to be given up too. But in philosophy the extended use is not supported by true or false opinions about natural processes. No fact†b justifies it (&)†c non can overturn it. Page 50 We say:†d "You understand this expression, don't you? Well, the way you always understand it†e is the way I too am using it."†f [Not: "... in that meaning..."] As though meaning were a halo which the word carries over†g†h into every sort of application MS 127 36v: 27.2.1944 Page 50 Thoughts at peace. That is the goal someone who philosophizes longs for.

MS 127 84r: 1944 Page 51 It will be hard to follow my portrayal: for it says something new, but still has eggshells of the old material sticking to it.

Page 51 A miracle is, as it were, a gesture which God makes. As a man sits quietly & then makes an impressive gesture, God lets the world run on smoothly & then accompanies the words of a Saint by a symbolic occurrence, a gesture of nature. It would be an instance if, when a saint has spoken, the trees around him bowed, as if in reverence.--Now, do I believe that this happens? I don't. Page 51 67 The only way for me to believe in a miracle in this sense would be to be impressed by an occurrence in this particular way. So that I should say e.g.: "It was impossible to see these trees & not to feel that they were responding to the words." Just as I might say "It is impossible to see the face of this dog & not to see that he is alert & full of attention to what his master is Page Break 52
