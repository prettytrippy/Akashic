tedly a picture that may be used only with caution, but here it can do us good service. To a concept without sharp boundary there would correspond an area that had not a sharp boundary-line all round, but in places just faded away into the background. This would not really be an area at all; and likewise a concept that is not sharply deﬁned is wrongly termed a concept. However, Bezirk means not ‘area’, but ‘region’, as in ‘an administra- tive region marked on a map’. §79(b) ‘The German original runs: ‘Unter “Moses” verstehe ich den Mann, der getan hat, was die Bibel von Moses berichtet, oder doch vieles davon. Aber wievieles? Habe ich mich entschieden, wieviel sich als falsch erweisen muß, damit ich meinen Satz als falsch aufgebe? Hat also der Name “Moses” für mich einen festen und eindeutig bestimmten Gebrauch in allen möglichen Fällen?’ Anscombe translated this as follows: By “Moses” I understand the man who did what the Bible relates of Moses, or at any rate a good deal of it. But how much? Have I decided how much must be proved false for me to give up my proposition as false? Has the name “Moses” got a ﬁxed and unequivocal use for me in all possible cases? However Wittgenstein corrected Rhees’s translation (TS 226, §86 (pp. 55–6)) thus: by “Moses” I understand <<mean>> the man who did what the Bible records of Moses, or at any rate a lot <<much>> of it. But how much? Have I come to any deci[sion |ded] as to how much <<of it>> must be shown <<turn out>> to be false in order that I should abandon <<give up>> my proposition <<statement>> as false? <<So>> Has <<is my use of>> the name “Moses” for me <<them>> a ﬁxed and clearly <<unambiguously>> determined use in <<for>> all possible cases? We have been guided by Wittgenstein’s modiﬁcations to Rhees’s translation. §81 ‘F. P. Ramsey once emphasized in conversation with me that logic was a “normative science”.’ I. A. Richards remarked in Scrutiny I, 408 (1933) that ‘a deﬁnition given by Charles Sanders Peirce . . . was a Notes to PI 43e–7e 249 favourite quotation of the late F. P. Ramsey: “Logic is the Ethics of think- ing, in the sense in which Ethics is the bringing to bear of self-control for the purposes of realizing our desires.”’ §82 ‘was er unter “N” verstehe’: Anscombe translated correctly ‘What he understood by “N”’, but we have opted for ‘What he meant by “N”’ in order to preserve continuity with Wittgenstein’s preferred translation of §79(b), line 3. §85 ‘Also kann ich sagen, der Wegweiser lässt doch keinen // einen // Zweifel offen’: in TS 227(a) Wittgenstein deleted the k in keinen a which makes much better sense. Hence we have changed the German text and Anscombe’s ‘the signpost does after all leave no room for doubt’ to ‘the signpost does after all leave room for doubt’. §86(c) Anscombe translated the last sentence ‘Und sind es die andern Tabellen ohne ihr Schema?’ as ‘And are other tables incomplete with- out their schemata?’. But in TS 226, Wittgenstein added here the paren- thesis ‘are the other (abnormal) tables . . .’, making it clear that he is referring to the examples of abnormal schemata just discussed a hence the addition of the deﬁnite article. §88(b) ‘colour edge’: where two different coloured regions meet. §89(a) ‘Is logic in some way sublime’ was Wittgenstein’s preferred translation (TS 226, §97 (p. 63)). §89(b) ‘Sie liege, so schien es, am Grunde aller Wissenschaften’: Wittgenstein preferred ‘foundation’ to ‘basis’. ‘Denn die logische Betrachtung erforscht das Wesen aller Dinge’: Anscombe translated ‘For logical investigation explores the nature of all things.’ Rhees translated Wesen as ‘essence’, which Wittgenstein accepted. The matter is non-trivial. Wesen can do service both for ‘essence’ and for ‘nature’. Here, the conception of logical investigation under dis- cussion is that which conceives of it as exploring the essence of all things. See note on §92 below.
