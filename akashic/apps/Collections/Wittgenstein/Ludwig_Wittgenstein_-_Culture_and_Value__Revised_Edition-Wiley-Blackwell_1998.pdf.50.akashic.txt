†19 Not clearly legible: either "for" or "then". Page 102 †20 Not clearly legible. "Maßeinheit--" Wittgenstein seems first to have written "Ein guter Maßstab" ("a good measuring rod"), then, changing the gender of the indefinite article appropriately, to have changed "Maßstab" to "Maßeinheit" ("unit of measurement"). The gender of "guter" (good") was not changed. Page 102 †21 It is unclear whether the text reads "diese" ("this" in its feminine form which would make it refer to "plausibility") or "dieser" ("this" in its masculine form which would make it refer to "narrative"). Page 102 †22 In the text there is an intrusive comma which makes no grammatical sense 122 and is clearly an error.

Page 102 †25 Wittgenstein's sister, Margarete Stonborough, for whom he built the house at 19 Kundmanngasse, Vienna. Page 102 †26 It is unclear in the text whether this should read "private performances" ("Leeraufführungen"--literally empty performances) or "training performances" ("Lehraufführungen"). Page 102 †27 Wittgenstein expressly notes above "not-admired": "hyphen". Page 102 †28 The sense of "(N.)" and "(W.)" is unclear. Page 102 †29 A department store in London. Page 102 †30 "scientists are not (...) on their laurels" is crossed out, which shows that Wittgenstein preferred the two subsequent alternatives. Page 102 †31 Cf. Editor's note on p. 302 of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, Second Edition. Page 102 †32 Cf. Philosophical Investigations, Part I, § 546. Page 102 123 †33 The German text is unclear as between "an" and "aus". [These involve a slight difference in emphasis: perhaps roughly, between "to find the rest of the way home from here" and "to find the rest of the way home from here onwards". But the difference, such as it is, can hardly be reproduced in English. (PW)] Page 102 †34 Gottfried Keller, The Lost Laugh. Page Break 103 Page 103 †35 Goethe, The Bride of Corinth. Page 103 †36 Philosophical Investigations, Part II, Section IV. Page 103 †37 Cf. Zettel § 175. Page 103 †38 Text unclear: either Section mark "S", "Oh es kann ein Schlüssel (...)" ["Oh a key can (...)"] or "Soh es kann ein Schlüssel (...)"--with the "h" in "Soh" crossed out ["So a key can (...)"]. Page 103 †39 Not clearly legible: either "etwas" ("something") or "etwa" ("perhaps"). Page 103 †40 Friedrich Nietzsche, Human, All-Too Human, I, § 155. Page 103 †41 "Urwerk". It is unclear whether this should read "Uhrwerk" [= "original work" or perhaps even "prototype"] or "Uhrwerk" ["clockwork" or simply "piece of machinery"]. Page 103 †42 During the Second World War and immediately after. Page 103 124 †43 Not clearly legible: either "nach" (= "after") or noch (= "yet or "still"). Page 103 †44 In the original: "Strike": unclear whether English "strike" or German "Streike" (= "strikes"). Page 103 †45 In the original "anchor" in "rescue-anchor" is crossed out; "the rescue- anchor" was replaced by the variant "the <rescue>-instrument". However in what follows ("rush up to it & seize it") the masculine pronoun "ihn" (corresponding to "anchor" is not replaced by the neuter pronoun "es" (corresponding to "instrument").
