no sense. For what the proponent of ‘the world as representation’ has ‘discovered’ is a new way of conceiving, characterizing, his experience of reality (cf. §401). So we have opted for ‘experience’, rather than  ‘sensation’ (cf. MS 120, 46v–47r, where ‘neue Empﬁndung’ and ‘neue Erfahrung’ appear to be used interchangeably in this context). §402(a) “Ich sage zwar ‘Ich habe jetzt die und die Vorstellung’”: Anscombe translated this as “It’s true I say ‘Now I am having such- and-such an image’”, and she translated ‘die Vorstellungswelt ist ganz in der Beschreibung der Vorstellung dargestellt’ as ‘the description of the image is a complete account of the imagined world’. However, this remark is not concerned with an imagined world, but rather with the ‘world as idea’ or the ‘world as experience’ a the ‘visual room’ intro- duced in §398 and discussed in §§399–401. To make this clear, we have opted for ‘visual image’ (to avoid confusion with mental images that one may have when one imagines visibilia), and ‘the ‘visual world’, which is the phrase Wittgenstein himself employed in his English lectures on this very theme. See ‘Notes for Lectures on “Private Experience” and “Sense Data”’, repr. in James C. Klagge and Alfred Nordmann, eds, Ludwig Wittgenstein b Philosophical Occasions 1912–1951 (Hackett, Indianapolis, 1993), pp. 258–9, 272; cp. p. 275. §436(a) ‘“are evanescent, and, in their coming to be and passing away, tend to produce these others”’: We have not been able to identify this ostensible quotation. In MS 146, 27, this has no quotation marks. Notes to PI 136e–49e 257 §436(b) ‘No words could be plainer or more commonly used. Yet their true meaning is concealed from us. We have still to ﬁnd it out.’ Augustine, Confessions, Bk XI, §22 (tr. R. S. Pine-Cofﬁn). §437 ‘(“The hardness of the logical must”.)’: here Wittgenstein is quot- ing himself from TS 221, p. 228 (= TS 222, p. 97); Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics (Blackwell, Oxford, 1978), Part I, §121, see also Part VI, §49). §441(b) ‘“For wishes themselves are a veil between us and the thing wished for”’: a quotation from Goethe’s Hermann und Dorothea, Canto V, line 69, tr. D. Coogan in Goethe, Hermann and Dorothea (Frederik Ungar, New York, 1966). §441(c) ‘“Do I know what I long for before I get it?”’: Anscombe’s mistranslation may be what Wittgenstein meant. The German is “Weiß ich, wonach ich lange, ehe ich es erhalte?”, which means “Do I know what I reach for before I get [or grasp] it?”. This single-sentence  paragraph does not occur in MSS but only in the ﬁnal TS. So it may have been dictated, and an error may have occurred in the typing.  For what Wittgenstein may have dictated was ‘wonach ich verlange’ a ‘what I long for’. We have therefore hesitantly stayed with Anscombe’s version. §454(a) ‘“Everything is already there in . . .”’: this is not a quotation, but an exclamation that Wittgenstein thought peculiarly characteristic of the situation in which we ﬁnd ourselves when we ‘hit bedrock’. See MS 124, 140 and 184f.; MS 127, 143 and 145. §458 Wittgenstein’s punctuation here is confusing. We have changed the quotation marks and added italics in the translation. §480 Wittgenstein has Meinung twice in the ﬁrst sentence. Translating it by ‘opinion’, as Anscombe did, is perfectly correct, but renders the continuity of the remark with the preceding one less clear than in the German, so we have translated Meinung here by ‘belief’. §518(a) ‘Socrates to Theaetetus’: Plato, Theaetetus 189a. Schleiermacher’s translation of the Theaetetus, which Wittgenstein apparently used here, has vorstellt (‘imagines’) here. The usual English translation is ‘thinks’,
