Mendelssohn did half-rigorously. Or: Brahms is often Mendelssohn without the flaws. Page Break 19 32 Page 19 †11 That must be the end of a theme which I cannot place†i. It occurred to me today as I was thinking about my work in philosophy & said to myself: "I destroy, I destroy, I destroy--" MS 154 21v: 1931 33 Page 19 It has sometimes been said that the Jews' secretive & cunning nature is a result of their long persecution. That is certainly untrue; on the other hand it is certain that, despite this persecution, they continue to exist only because they have the inclination towards this secretiveness. As we may say that such & such an animal has escaped extinction only because it has the possibility or capability of concealing itself. Of course I do not mean that one should commend this ability for such a reason, not by any means. Page 19 In Bruckner's music nothing is left of the long & slender (nordic?) face of Nestroy, Grillparzer, Haydn, etc. but it has in full measure a round full (alpine?) face even purer in type than was Schubert's. Page 19 The power of language to make everything look the same which appears in its crassest form in the dictionary & which makes it possible to personify time, something which is no less remarkable than would have been making divinities of the logical constants.

MS 155 29r: 1931 Page 20 The pleasure I take in my thoughts is pleasure in my own strange life. Is this joi de vivre? MS 155 46r: 1931 Page 20 By the way in†a the old conception--roughly that of the (great) western philosophers--there were two†b sorts of problem in the scientific sense: essential, great, universal, & inessential, as it were accidental, problems. Our conception on the contrary is that there is no great essential problem in the scientific sense.†i MS 110 200: 22.6.1931 Page 20 34 Structure & feeling in music. Feelings accompany our grasp of a piece of music as they accompany events in our life. MS 110 226: 25.6.1931 Page 20 Labor's seriousness is a very late seriousness. MS 110 231 c: 29.6.1931 Page 20 Talent is a spring from which fresh water is constantly flowing. But this spring loses its value if it is not used†c in the right way. MS 110 238: 30.6.1931 Page 20 "What a sensible man knows is hard to know." Does Goethe's contempt for laboratory experiment and his exhortation to go out into uncontrolled nature & learn from that, does this have some connection with the idea that a hypothesis (wrongly conceived) is already a falsification of the truth? And with the beginning I am now thinking of for my book which might consist of a description of nature?†d MS 110 257: 2.7.1931 Page 20 If people find a flower or an animal ugly they always have an impression as though they were artifacts. "It looks like a ..." they say. This sheds light on the meaning of the words "ugly" & "beautiful".

MS 111 2c: 7.7.1931 Page 21 Reading the Socratic dialogues, one has the feeling: what a frightful waste of time! What's the point of these arguments that prove nothing & clarify nothing. MS 111 55: 30.7.1931 Page 21 The story of Peter Schlemihl†13 should, it seems to me, go†a like this: He makes over his soul to the Devil for money. Then he repents it & now the Devil demands his shadow as ransom. But Peter Schlemihl still has a choice between giving the Devil his soul or sacrificing along with his shadow life in community with human 35 beings. MS 111 77:11.8.1931 Page 21 In Christianity it is as though God said to human beings: Don't act a tragedy, that is to say, don't enact heaven & hell on earth, heaven & hell are my affair.
