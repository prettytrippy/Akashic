tendency to assume a pure (immaterial) entity mediating between the propositional sign and the facts’. §95 Unlike Anscombe, Rhees translated Denken as ‘Thinking’ (TS 226, §105 (p. 67)), which Wittgenstein retained. We have followed this translation. §97 Rhees again translated Das Denken as ‘Thinking’ (TS 226, §107 (p. 68)), consistently with his translation of §95. Wittgenstein wrote ‘Thought’ above, but subsequently deleted this alteration, leaving Rhees’s translation intact. §98 ‘every sentence in our language “is in order as it is”’: a reference to Tractatus 5.5563 a ‘In fact, all the propositions of our everyday lan- guage, just as they stand, are in perfect logical order.’ §100 ‘vollkommenes’: Anscombe, following Rhees (TS 226, §111 (p. 70)), translated this as ‘perfect’, but in the 3rd edition changed it to ‘complete’. We have retained ‘perfect’ (which Wittgenstein did not delete in TS 226), since completeness is not at issue, and ‘vollkommene Sprache’ and ‘voll- kommene Ordnung’ were translated as ‘perfect language’ and ‘perfect order’ in §98 by both Rhees (with Wittgenstein’s approval) and Anscombe. ‘die Rolle, die das Ideal in unsrer Ausdrucksweise spielt’: Ausdrucks- weise, strictly speaking, means ‘mode of expression’ or ‘speech’, but 252 Notes to PI 50e–5e Wittgenstein tentatively corrected this to ‘language’ in Rhees’s transla- tion (TS 226, §111 (p. 70)), and, like Anscombe, we have followed him. Boxed remark between §104 and §105: its location is indicated by an asterisk after the ﬁrst sentence of §104 and associated asterisk in a note in another’s hand in TS 227(b). The reference is to M. Faraday, The Chemical History of a Candle (Hutchinson, London, 1907), p. 44. Boxed remark between §108 and §109: printed in the ﬁrst two editions as paragraphs (b)–(d) of §108, these three remarks (and the marginal note printed in square brackets) are from a handwritten note on a slip of paper, inserted between pp. 82 and 83 of TSS 227(a). Their proxi- mate source is TS 228, §503. There is no clear indication as to where exactly to place it. §109 ‘It was correct that our considerations must not be scientiﬁc ones’: an allusion to Tractatus 4.111: ‘Philosophy is not one of the natural sci- ences. (The word “philosophy” must mean something whose place is above or below the natural sciences, not beside them.)’ ‘The feeling “that it is possible, contrary to our preconceived ideas, to think this or that” . . . could be of no interest to us’: perhaps an allu- sion to Frank Ramsey’s remark ‘but it just is possible to think of such a thing’ (MS 116, 51); see also MS 152, 93–5; Philosophical Remarks 304 (= MS 105, 23); Zettel, §272. §122 ‘Übersicht’, ‘übersehbar’, ‘Übersichlichkeit’, ‘übersichtliche Darstellung’: we have tried to preserve the reference to view and sur- vey in translating Übersicht and its cognates, hence ‘overview’, ‘sur- veyability’, ‘surveyable’, and ‘surveyable representation’ as opposed to Anscombe’s ‘perspicuous representation’. §124(d) ‘A “leading problem of mathematical logic”’: Wittgenstein asso- ciated this phrase with Frank Ramsey (see MS 110, 189; The Big Typescript (Blackwell, Oxford, 2004), pp. 417f.; MS 115, 71). §127 Erinnerungen can mean ‘reminder’, but in this context it signiﬁes things remembered a not something that will remind one of the things one has learnt and knows full well, but those very things themselves. The Big Typescript, p. 419 (cp. MS 115, 164), just after a draft of an early version of Investigations §128 and before one of §129 has the remark ‘Learning philosophy is really recollecting. We remember that we really Notes to PI 57e–63e 253 used words in this way.’ Cf. MS 110, 131f., where he associates this with Socrates.
