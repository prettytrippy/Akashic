Boxed remark between §133 and §134: in previous editions, this was printed as paragraph (d) of §133. But it is in fact a slip cut from TS 228, §140, inserted on p. 91 of TS 227 with the editorial inscription  ‘p. 91 Footnote’ in TS 227(a) and ‘Note to p. 91’ in TS 227(b). §134 ‘Satz’: this remark exempliﬁes all the problems that arise in trans- lating the German Satz (see ‘Editorial Preface’, p. xiv). Although we  have replaced most of Anscombe’s uses of ‘proposition’ here by ‘sen- tence’, we have not done so in the cases of ‘general propositional form’, ‘propositional schema’, ‘propositional variable’ and ‘our concept of a proposition’, especially in view of the sequel in §§135–6. Boxed remark between §138 and §139: this is the content of one of four slips inserted at this point in TS 227. A handwritten note in the mar- gin makes it clear that the boxed remark is connected with §138. Originally, the printed remark was preceded by another version of PI §500 and followed by what are now the boxed remarks between §549 and §550. Presumably the lost copy of TS 227 contained instructions to the effect that only the present remark was to be printed at this point. The proximate source of this remark is TS 228, §82. Boxed remarks between §139 and §140: these two remarks were writ- ten on a separate sheet of paper inserted between pp. 95 and 96 of the TS. The proximate source of (a) is TS 228, §363; that of (b) is TS 228, §335. Boxed remark between §142 and §143: inserted on a slip of paper marked ‘p. 99’ between pp. 98 and 99 of TS 227(a), with a marginal handwritten note on the left of §142 reading ‘Footnote: Slip attached’. The proxi- mate source is TS 228, §357. §144 ‘Indian mathematicians: “Look at this!” ’: Zettel, §461, and MS 142, §146 (corrected numeration; §144 in Wittgenstein’s numeration)  clarify: ‘I read somewhere that Indian mathematicians are (sometimes) content to use a geometrical ﬁgure accompanied by the words “Look at this!” as a proof of a theorem. This looking too effects an altera- tion in one’s way of seeing (Anschauungsweise).’ Cf. MS 161, 6; MS 110, 152. 254 Notes to PI 65e–102e Boxed remarks between §149 and §150: in TS 227(a) this pair of remarks, typed on separate slips of paper, was inserted between pp. 103 and 104. In TS 227(b) the remarks are inserted between pp. 102 and 103. Their proximate sources are TS 228, §79 and §86. Boxed remark between §165 and §166: in TS 227(a) this remark occurs between pp. 115 and 116. The ﬁrst paragraph is a handwritten addi- tion above the typed paragraph (b). Paragraph (b) was cut from TS 228, §395. §169 The sequence of typographical symbols that were typed into TS 227 (and hence printed in earlier editions) were evidently a substitute for a series of arbitrary squiggles, as in Eine Philosophische Betrach- tung (Suhrkamp, Frankfurt, 1970), p. 182. We have accordingly repro- duced those. §226(a) ‘working out the series 2x −1’: Wittgenstein wrote ‘x2 + 1’, which is a slip. Anscombe changed this to read ‘2x + 1’, but the cor- rect formula for this series is ‘2x −1’. §228 ‘A series presents us with one face . . . read the lips of a rule . . .’: Anscombe clearly disliked Wittgenstein’s metaphor of the facial phys- iognomy of a rule of a series and accordingly suppressed it. This is unwar- ranted, and we have restored it. This conceit links up with his subsequent discussion of the physiognomy of word meaning (§568; see also PPF §§38, 238, 294). §§272–4 ‘Rotempﬁndung’, ‘Empﬁndung von Rot’, ‘die eigene Emp- ﬁndung’: Anscombe translated these words by the phrase ‘sensation  of red’ and ‘the private sensation’ (§274). However, there is no such
