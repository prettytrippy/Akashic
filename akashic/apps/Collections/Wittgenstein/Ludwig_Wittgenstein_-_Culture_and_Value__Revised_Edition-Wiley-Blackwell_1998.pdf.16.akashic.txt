of these two specialized words for my case & nothing would be lost from the sense of what I wanted to say. One might say: how would I explain the word 'rule' or 'plant' in the particular case then? that will show 'what I mean by it'. Suppose I had said: "the gardener raises very beautiful plants in this greenhouse". I want to communicate something to my hearer with this & the question arises: for this does he have to know what is common to everything that we call "plant"? No. I could quite well have given him the explanation for the case in hand by means of a few examples or a few pictures. 42 In the same way if I say: "I will just explain the rules of this game to you", do I presuppose that the other knows everything that is common to what we call "rule"? MS 145 14r: Autumn 1933* Page 28 If I say A. has beautiful eyes I may be asked: What do you find beautiful about his eyes & perhaps I will answer: the almond shape, the long lashes, the delicate lids. What do these eyes have in common with a Gothic church that I also find beautiful? Am I to say they make a similar impression on me? What if I said: what they have in common is that in both cases my hand is tempted to draw them? That at any rate would be a narrow definition of theâ€ a beautiful. It will often be possible to say: ask what your reasons are for calling something good or beautiful & the particular grammar of the word "good" in this case will be apparent. MS 145 17v: 1933 Page 28 I believe I summed up where I stand in relation to philosophy when I said: really one should write philosophy only as one writes a poem. That, it seems to me, must reveal how far my thinking belongs to the present, the future, or the past. For I was acknowledging myself, with these words, to be someone who cannot quite do what he would like to be able to do. MS 146 25v: 1933-1934 Page 28 If you use a trick in logic, whom can you be tricking but yourself? MS 146 35v: 1933-1934 Page Break 29 Composers' names. Sometimes it is the method of projection that we treat as given. When we, say, ask What name would hit off this person's character But sometimes we project the character into the name & treat that as given. Thus we get the impression that the great masters we know so well have just the names that suit their work. MS 146 44v: 1933-1934 Page 29 If someone prophesies that the generation to come will take up these problems & solve them that is usually a sort of wishful thinking, a way of excusing oneself for what one should have accomplished & hasn't. A father would like his son to achieve what he has not achieved so that the task he left unresolved should find a resolution nevertheless. But his son is faced with a new task. I mean: the wish that 43 the task should not remain unfinished disguises itself as a prediction that it will be taken further by the next generation. MS 147 16r: 1934 Page 29 The overwhelming skill in Brahms. MS 147 22r: 1934 Page 29 If I say: "that is the only thing that is really seen" I point in front of me. If I were to point sideways or behind me however--at things that I did not see--this pointing would lose all its sense for me. That means, though that my pointing in front of me is not contrasted with anything. (Someone who is in a hurry will when sitting in a car push involuntarily, even though he may tell himself that he is not pushing the car at all.) MS 157a 2r: 1934* Page 29 By the way, in my artistic activities I have merely good manners. MS 157a 22v: 1934 Page 29 In the days of silent films all the classics were played with the films, except Brahms & Wagner. Not Brahms because he is too abstract. I can imagine an exciting scene in a film accompanied with music by Beethoven or Schubert & might gain some sort of understanding of the music from the film. But not an understanding of music by Brahms. Bruckner on the other hand does go with a film. MS 157a 44v: 1934 or 1937 Page 29 The queer resemblance between a philosophical investigation (perhaps especially in mathematics <)> and one in aesthetics. (E.g. what is bad about this garment, how it should be, etc..) MS 116 56: 1937 Page Break 30
