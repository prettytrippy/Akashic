It is difficult to know something, & to act as though you didn't know it. MS 137 143a: 7.-8.1.1949 Page 90 There really are cases in which one†c has the sense of what one†d wants to say much more clearly in mind than he†e†54 can express in words. (This happens to me very often.) It is as though one remembered a dream very clearly, but could not give a good account of it.†f Indeed the image often stays there behind the words for the writer (me), so that they seem to describe it to me. Page 90 A mediocre writer must beware of too quickly replacing a crude, incorrect expression with a correct one. By doing so he kills the original idea, which was still at least a living seedling. And now it is shrivelled & no longer worth anything. He may now just as well throw it on the rubbish heap. Whereas the pitiful seedling still had a certain usefulness. MS 138 2a: 17.1.1949 Page 90 108 That writers, who after all were something, go out of date is connected with the fact that their writings, when complemented by the setting of their own age, speak strongly to people, but that they die without this complementation, as if bereft of the lighting that gave them colour. And I believe that the beauty of mathematical demonstrations, as experienced by Pascal too, is connected with this. Within this way of Page Break 91 looking at the world these demonstrations did have beauty--not what superficial people call beauty. A crystal too is not beautiful in every 'setting'--though perhaps everywhere attractive.-- Page 91 The way whole periods are incapable of freeing themselves from the grip of certain concepts--e.g. the concept 'beautiful' & 'beauty'. MS 138 3a: 18.1.1949 Page 91 My own thinking about art & values is far more disillusioned, than would have been possible for people 100 years ago. However that does not mean that it is more correct on that account. It only means that there are examples of decline in the forefront of my mind, which were not in the forefront for those people then. MS 138 4a: 18.1.1949 Page 91 Troubles are like illnesses; you have to put up with them: the worst thing you can do is, rebel against them. They come in attacks too, triggered by inner, or outer causes. And then you must tell yourself: "Another attack". MS 138 4b: 19.1.1949 Page 91 Scientific questions may interest me, but they never really grip†a me. Only conceptual & aesthetic questions have that effect on me. At bottom it leaves me cold whether scientific problems are solved; but not those other questions. MS 138 5b: 21.1.1949 Page 91 Even if we are not thinking in circles, still, we sometimes walk straight through the thicket of questions out into the open country, sometimes†b along tortuous, or 109 zigzagging paths, which don't take us into the open country. MS 138 8a: 22.1.1949 Page 91 The Sabbath is not simply a time to rest, to recuperate. We are supposed to look at our work from the outside, not just from within. MS 138 8b: 23.1.1949 Page 91 This is how philosophers should salute each other: "Take your time!" MS 138 9a: 24.1.1949 Page Break 92 Page 92 For a human being the eternal, the consequential is often hidden behind an impenetrable veil. He knows: there is something under there, but he cannot see it; the veil reflects the daylight. MS 138 9a: 24.1.1949 Page 92 Why shouldn't someone become desperately unhappy? It is one human possibility. As in 'Corinthian Bagatelle', this is one of the possible paths for the balls. And perhaps not even one of the rarest. MS 138 9b: 25.1.1949 Page 92 The valleys of foolishness have more grass growing in them for the philosopher than do the barren heights of cleverness. MS 138 11a: 28.1.1949 Page 92 Isochronism according to the clock & isochronism in music. They are by no means equivalent concepts. Playing in strict time, does not mean playing exactly according to the metronome. But it would be possible that a certain kind of music should be played according to the metronome. (Is the opening theme <of the second movement> of the 8th symphony of this kind?) MS 138 12a: 30.1.1949 Page 92
