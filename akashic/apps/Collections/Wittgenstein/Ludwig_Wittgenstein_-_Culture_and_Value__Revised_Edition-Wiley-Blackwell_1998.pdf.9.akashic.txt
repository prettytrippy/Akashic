Or more precisely it just is no longer an epic, or is one Page Break 12 only for someone who observes it from outside & perhaps Beethoven did this with prevision (as Spengler hints in one place) It might be said that civilization can only have its epic poet in advance. Just as one can only foresee one's own death and describe it as something lying in the future, not report it as it happens. So it might be said: If you want to see the epic of a whole culture written†a you will have to seek it in the works of its greatest figures and hence seek it at a time when the end of this culture can only be foreseen, for later there is no one there any more to 24 describe it. So it is not to be wondered at that it should be written in the dark language of prevision†b & intelligible only to the very few. Page 12 But I do not get to these problems at all. When I "have done with the world" I have created an amorphous (transparent) mass & and the world in all its variety is left on one side like an uninteresting lumber room. Or perhaps more precisely: the whole outcome of the entire work is for the world to be set on one side. (A throwing-into-the-lumber-room of the whole world) Page 12 In this world (mine) there is no tragedy & with that all the endlessness that gives rise to tragedy (as its result†c) is lacking It is as though everything were soluble in the ether;†d there are no harnesses. This means that hardness & conflict do not become something splendid†e but a defect. Page 12 Conflict is dissipated in much the same way as is the tension of a spring in a mechanism that you melt (or dissolve in nitric acid). In this†f solution tensions no longer exist. MS 110 12: 12.-16.1.1931 Page 12 If I say that my book is meant for only a small circle of people (if that can be called a circle) I do not mean to say that this circle is in my view the élite of mankind but it is the circle to which†g I turn (not because they are better or worse than the others but) because they form my cultural circle, as it Page Break 13 were my fellow countrymen in contrast to the others who are foreign to me. MS 110 18: 18.1.1931 Page 13 The limit of language manifests itself in the impossibility of describing the fact that corresponds to (is the translation of) a sentence without simply repeating the sentence. 25 Page 13 (We are involved here with the Kantian solution of the problem of philosophy.) MS 110 61: 10.2.1931 Page 13 Can I say that drama has its own time which is not a segment of historical time. I.e. I can speak of earlier and later within it but there is no sense to the question whether the events in it took place, say, before or after Caesar's death. MS 110 67: 12.2.1931 Page 13 The charming difference in temperature between the parts of a human body. MS 153a 4v: 10.5.1931 Page 13 It is humiliating having to present oneself as an empty tube only inflated by the mind. MS 153a 12v: 1931 Page 13 No one likes having offended another person; that is why it does everyone good when the other person doesn't show that he has been offended. Nobody likes being confronted by a wounded spaniel. Remember that. It is much easier patiently--& tolerantly†i--to avoid the person that offended you than to approach him as a friend. You need courage too for that. MS 153a 18v 1931 Page 13 To treat well somebody who does not like you requires not just great good nature but great tact too.

MS 153a 35r: 1931 Page 13 Compare the solution of philosophical problems with the fairy tale gift that seems magical in the enchanted castle and if it is looked at in daylight 26 Page Break 14 is nothing but an ordinary bit of iron (or something of the sort). MS 153a 35v: 1931 Page 14 A thinker is very similar to a draughtsman. Who wants†a to represent all the interconnections. MS 153a 90v: 1931 Page 14 Pieces of music composed at the keyboard, those by thinking with the pen & those composed just with imagined sounds must be of quite a different kind†b and make quite different kinds of impression.
