--in human terms--is right.--But isn't it right all the same? i.e. can it not be applied? Indeed, it has been applied. (At railway stations there are dials with two hands, they indicate when the next train leaves. They look like clocks & aren't; but they have a†a use.) (There should be a better comparison here.) Page 88 To someone who is upset by this†b allegory it might be said: Apply it differently or don't bother with it! (But some will be far more confused than helped by it.) MS 137 130a: 22.12.1948 Page 88 Anything the reader can do for himself, leave it to the reader. MS 137 134b: 25.12.1948 Page 88 Almost the whole time I am writing conversations with myself. Things I say to myself tête-à-tête. MS 137 134b: 26.12.1948 Page 88 Ambition is the death of thought. MS 137 135a: 27.12.1948 Page 88 Humour is not a mood, but a way of looking at the world. So, if it's right to say that humour was eradicated in Nazi Germany, that does not mean that people were not in good spirits or anything of that sort, but something much deeper & more important. MS 137 135a: 28.12.1948 Page 88 Two people who are laughing together, at a joke perhaps. One of them has said†c certain somewhat unusual words & now they both break out into a sort of bleating. That might appear very bizarre to someone arriving among us from a quite different background. Whereas we find it quite reasonable. 106 (I witnessed this scene recently on a bus & was able to think myself into the skin of someone not accustomed to it. It struck me then as quite irrational & like the reactions of an outlandish animal.) MS 137 136b: 31.12.1948 Page 88 Recounting a dream, a medley of recollections. Often forming a significant & enigmatic whole. As it were a fragment, that makes a powerful impression on us (sometimes that is), so that we look for an explanation, for connections. Page Break 89 Page 89 But why did these recollections come now? Who will say?--It may be connected with our present life, and so too with our wishes, fears, etc. "But do you mean to say that this phenomenon must exist in the particular causal interconnection?"--I mean to say that it does not necessarily make sense to speak of discovering its cause. Page 89 Shakespeare & the dream. A dream is all wrong, absurd, composite, & yet completely right: in this strange concoction it makes an impression. Why? I don't know. And if Shakespeare is great, as he is said to be, then we must be able to say of him: Everything is wrong, things aren't like that--& is all the same completely right according to a law of its own. It could be put like this too: If Shakespeare is great, then he can be so only in the whole corpus of his plays, which create their own language & world. So he is completely unrealistic. (Like the dream.) MS 168 1r: January 1949 Page 89 If Christianity is the truth, then all the philosophy about it is false. MS 169 58v: 1949 Page 89 Culture is an observance. Or at least presupposes an observance. MS 169 62v: 1949 Page 89 The concept of a 'festivity'. Connected for us with merrymaking; perhaps in another age only with fear & dread. What we call "wit" & what we call "humour" 107 doubtless did not exist in other ages. And both these are perpetually†a changing.†b MS 137 137a: 1.1.1949 Page 89 "Le style c'est l'homme." "Le style c'est l'homme même." The first expression has a cheap epigrammatic brevity. The second, correct, one opens up a quite different perspective. It says that style is the picture of the man. Page 89 There are remarks that sow, & remarks that reap. MS 137 140a: 4.1.1949 Page Break 90 To piece together†a the landscape of these conceptual relationships out of their individual fragments†b is too difficult for me. I can make only a very imperfect job of it. MS 137 141a: 6.1.1949 Page 90 If I prepare myself for some eventuality, you can be pretty sure that it won't happen. Perhaps.†i Page 90
