Sussex, 1976), Lecture XXI, p. 208); see also MS 107, 226f. (cf. Philosophical Remarks (Blackwell, Oxford, 1975), pp. 207f.), which is comparable to Zettel (Blackwell, Oxford, 1967), §691. §19(a) ‘Und unzähliges Andere’ is unclear. Wittgenstein altered Rhees’s translation (TS 226, §22 (p. 10)), from ‘And countless others’ to ‘And countless other things’. We have followed his translation. §20(a) The translation of the penultimate line of this paragraph is based on Wittgenstein’s alterations to Rhees’s translation. Notes to PI 12e–22e 245 §20(b) The rather free rendering of the concluding German sentence  of this paragraph is based on Wittgenstein’s modiﬁcation to Rhees’s  translation. §22(a) Frege used the word Annahme (‘assumption’) to signify the con- tent of a possible assertion (see ‘Function and Concept’, repr. in his Collected Papers on Mathematics, Logic, and Philosophy (Blackwell, Oxford, 1984), p. 149; pp. 21f. in the original German pagination). §22(d) Frege’s assertion sign is the ‘turnstile’, |a, which is composed of the sign of assertion or judgement-stroke ‘|’, and the content-stroke or horizontal ‘a’, which is a function sign denoting a function from objects (including contents of possible judgements (assertions) or thoughts) to truth-values. See The Basic Laws of Arithmetic, vol. i (1893), §5 (cp. Begriffschrift (1879) (Conceptual Notation and Related Articles (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1972)), §2). Boxed remark between §22 and §23 has been relocated from the bot- tom of p. 11 in the ﬁrst two editions. Immediately derived from TS 228, §432, it was inserted into TS 227(a) and (b) as handwritten slips in another hand, with the note ‘Insertion at the end of §22’. In TS 227(b) this note was deleted, apparently in yet another hand. It is possible that this para- graph was intended as paragraph (e) of §22. §25 Wittgenstein corrected Rhees’s translation ‘Commanding, asking, recounting’ to ‘Giving orders, asking questions, describing’, and we have followed his correction, while translating erzählen by ‘telling stories’, rather than ‘describing’. Boxed remark between §28 and §29 has been relocated from the bot- tom of p. 14 in the ﬁrst two editions. These two paragraphs are cut from TS 228, §522, and inserted between pp. 24 and 25 of the ﬁnal type- script. In both copies of TS 227, the inserted slip has written on it the words ‘Insertion at end of §28’. Boxed remark between §35 and §36, paragraph (b): square brackets are used to indicate Wittgenstein’s handwritten addendum on the slip of paper, cut from TS 228, §36, and inserted between pp. 30 and 31 of TS 227(a). §38(a) ‘the word “this” has been called the real name’: a reference to Russell; see, e.g., Theory of Knowledge b The 1913 Manuscript, in The 246 Notes to PI 23e–8e Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, vol. 7, ed. E. R. Eames in col- laboration with K. Blackwell (Allen and Unwin, London, 1984), pp. 39f., and even more emphatically in ‘The Philosophy of Logical Atomism’, repr. in The Philosophy of Logical Atomism and Other Essays 1914– 1919, ed. J. G. Slater, in The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, vol. 8 (Allen and Unwin, London, 1986), p. 170. §39 Wittgenstein used the name ‘Nothung’, which is the name of Siegfried’s sword in Wagner’s Ring, which was shattered. In TS 226, §46 (p. 27), Wittgenstein replaced the ﬁrst occurrence of ‘Nothung’ by ‘Escaliber’ [sic], but not the subsequent occurrences a perhaps because it then occurred to him that Excalibur was not shattered and reassem- bled, and was therefore less apt to illustrate the point. §46(b) ‘Socrates says in the Theaetetus’: see Plato, Theaetetus 201e–202b.
