movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony. (Compare too Schopenhauer's remark about universal music composed to a particular text.)†24 MS 121 26v: 25.5.1938 54 Page 40 In philosophy the winner of the race is the one who can run most slowly. Or: the one who gets to the winning post last.†a†b MS 121 35v: 11.6.1938 Page 40 Being psychoanalyzed is in a way like eating from the tree of knowledge.†c The knowledge we acquire sets us (new) ethical problems; but contributes nothing to their solution. MS 122 129: 30.12.1939 Page 40 What is lacking in Mendelssohn's music? A 'courageous' melody? MS 162a 18: 1939-1940 Page 40 The Old Testament seen as the body without its head; the New T.: the head; the Epistles of the Apostles: the crown on the head. If I think of the Jewish Bible, the Old Testament on its own, I should like to say: the head is (still) missing from this body The solution to these problems is missing The fulfilment of these hopes is missing. But I do not necessarily think of a head as having a crown. MS 162b 16v: 1939-1940 Page 40 Envy is something superficial--i.e.: the typical colour of envy does not go down deep--farther down passion has a different colouring. (That does not, of course, make envy any less real.) MS 162 21v: 1939-1940 Page 40 The measure of genius is character,--even if character on its own does not amount to genius Genius is not 'talent and character', but character manifesting itself in the form of a special talent. Where one man will show courage by jumping into the water, another will show courage by writing a symphony. (This is a weak example.) MS 162b 22r c: 1939-1940 Page Break 41 There is no more light in a genius than in any other honest human being--but the genius concentrates this light into a burning point by means of a particular kind of 55 lens. Page 41 Why is the soul moved by idle thoughts,--since they are after all idle? Well, it is moved by them. (How can the wind move a tree, since it is after all just wind†a ? Well, it does move it; & don't forget it.) MS 162b 24r: 1939-1940 Page 41 One cannot speak the truth;--if one has not yet conquered oneself. One cannot speak it--but not, because one is still not clever enough. Page 41 The truth can be spoken only by someone who is already at home in it; not by someone who still lives in untruthfulness, & does no more than reach out towards it from within untruthfulness. MS 162b 37r c: 1939-1940 Page 41 Resting on your laurels is as dangerous as resting when hiking through snow. You doze off & die in your sleep. MS 162b 42v c: 1939-1940 Page 41 The monstrous vanity of wishes is revealed for instance in†b my wish to fill a nice notebook with writing as soon as possible. I get nothing from this; it's not that I wish it because, say, it will be evidence of my productivity; it is simply a longing to rid myself of something familiar as soon as I can; although of course, as soon as I am rid of it, I must start a fresh one & the whole business will have to be repeated. MS 162b 53r: 1939-1940 Page 41 One could call Schopenhauer a quite crude mind. I.e.,†c He does have refinement, but at a certain level this suddenly comes to an end & he is as crude as the crudest. Where real depth starts, his finishes. Page 41 One might say of Schopenhauer: he never takes stock of himself. Page Break 42 56 I sit astride life like a bad rider on his mount. I owe it solely to the horse's good nature that I am not thrown off right now. MS 162b 55v: 1939-1940 Page 42 'The impression (made by this melody) is completely indescribable.'- That means: a description is no use (for my purpose); you have to hear the melody. If art serves 'to arouse feelings', is, perhaps, perceiving it with the senses included amongst these feelings? MS 162b 59r: 1939-1940* Page 42
