‡ Erich Fromm, in his important discussion of Freud’s character, also fixes on helplessness and dependency as the underside of Freud and so also confirms Jones. But Fromm seems to me to accent it too much as an ambivalent reflex of Freud’s childhood relationship to his mother, whereas I am seeing it more as a universal phenomenon reacting to Freud’s distinctive heroic ambition and burdens. See Fromm, Sigmund Freud’s Mission, Chapter 5.
