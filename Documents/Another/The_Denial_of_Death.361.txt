Make inward bedlamâ€”and will not come out. Why should we? Stripped of subtle complications, Who could regard the sun except with fear? This is our shelter against contemplation, Our only refuge from the plain and clear. Who would crawl out from under the obscure To stand defenseless in the sunny air? No terror of obliquity so sure As the most shining terror of despair To know how simple is our deepest need, How sharp, and how impossible to feed.19
