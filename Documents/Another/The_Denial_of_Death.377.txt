Man’s anxiety is a function of his sheer ambiguity and of his complete powerlessness to overcome that ambiguity, to be straightforwardly an animal or an angel. He cannot live heedless of his fate, nor can he take sure control over that fate and triumph over it by being outside the human condition: The spirit cannot do away with itself [i.e., self-consciousness cannot disappear]… . Neither can man sink down into the vegetative life [i.e., be wholly an animal]… . He cannot flee from dread.8
