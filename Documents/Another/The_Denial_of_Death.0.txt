 “CHALLENGING” “POWERFUL” “MAGNIFICENT” “… one of the most challenging books of the decade….” —Anatole Broyard, The New York Times “A magnificent psychophilosophical synthesis which ranks among the truly important books of the year. Professor Becker writes with power and brilliant insight … moves unflinchingly toward a masterful articulation of the limitations of psychoanalysis and of reason itself in helping man transcend his conflicting fears of both death and life … his book will be acknowledged as a major work.”
