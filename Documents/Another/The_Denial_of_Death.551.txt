The most he could do was to give way to common superstitions. I think this conclusion is beyond dispute on the basis of Jones’s reports alone; but we also have Freud’s telling personal admission that “my own superstition has its roots in suppressed ambition (immortality)… .”30 That is, it has its roots in the strictly spiritual problem of transcending death, a problem that for Freud was characteristically one of ambition, of striving, and not of trust or yielding.
