General Life-Problem There has been a lot of interpretation of the meaning of these fainting episodes by many sensitive students of Freud’s life; Freud and Jung both gave their own interpretations. I am lingering on this subject not only because it may unlock the problem of Freud’s character, but because it confirms better than anything, I think, the whole post-Freudian understanding of man that we have sketched in the first five chapters. We get the clearest understanding when we can reflect abstractions in the living mirror of a great man’s life.
