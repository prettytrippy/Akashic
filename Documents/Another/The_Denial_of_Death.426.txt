possibility. As Kierkegaard sums it up: The loss of possibility signifies: either that everything has become necessary to man or that everything has become trivial.32 Actually, in the extreme of depressive psychosis we seem to see the merger of these two: everything becomes necessary and trivial at the same time—which leads to complete despair. Necessity with the illusion of meaning would be the highest achievement for man; but when it becomes trivial there is no sense to one’s life.
