Take, for example, Freud’s seasoned thoughts on human nature, and his idea of where he stood on the pyramid of struggling mankind: … I have found little that is “good” about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or none at all… . If we are to talk of ethics, I subscribe to a high ideal from which most of the human beings I have come across depart most lamentably.1
