inner identity. The beast has none. It is ignorant, says Kierkegaard, therefore innocent; but man is a “synthesis of the soulish and bodily”6 and so experiences anxiety. Again, for “soulish” we must read “self-conscious.” If a man were a beast or an angel, he would not be able to be in dread. [That is, if he were utterly unself-conscious or totally un-animal] Since he is a synthesis he can be in dread … man himself produces dread.7
