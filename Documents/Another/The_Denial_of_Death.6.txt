“A profound synthesis of theological and psychological insights about man’s nature and his incessant efforts to escape the burden of life—and death—. It is hard to over-estimate the importance of this book; Becker succeeds brilliantly in what he sets out to do, and the effort was necessary.” —The Chicago Sun-Times  FREE PRESS A Division of Simon & Schuster Inc. 1230 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10020 Copyright © 1973 by The Free Press All rights reserved,
