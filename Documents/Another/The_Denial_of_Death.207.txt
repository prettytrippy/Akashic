Erwin Straus, in his brilliant monograph on obsession,8 similarly earlier showed how repulsed Swift was by the animality of the body, by its dirt and decay. Straus pronounced a more clinical judgment on Swift’s disgust, seeing it as part of the typical obsessive’s worldview: “For all obsessives sex is severed from unification and procreation… . Through the … isolation of the genitals from the whole of the body, sexual functions are experienced as excretions and as decay.”9
