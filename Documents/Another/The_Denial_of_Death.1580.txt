† Kierkegaard’s use of “self” may be a bit confusing. He uses it to include the symbolic self and the physical body. It is a synonym really for “total personality” that goes beyond the person to include what we would now call the “soul” or the “ground of being” out of which the created person sprang. But this is not important for us here, except to introduce the idea that the total person is a dualism of finitude and infinitude.
